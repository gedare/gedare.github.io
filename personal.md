# A bit more about me
I was born and raised in rural Wisconsin.
I graduated high school in the suburbs of Nashville, and went to college at
Michigan Tech.

I got my Ph.D. inspired by my role model, my
grandfather, the late Laird W. Heal
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3A%22LW+Heal%22&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C47&as_vis=1").
  	  
I enjoy cycling, hiking, fishing, strength training, coding for fun,
sauna, coffee, forests, lakes, and family.
