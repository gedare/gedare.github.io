# A bit more about me
I was born and raised outside of
[Eagle River, WI](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eagle+River,+WI+54521/),
a small resort town in the Northwoods of Wisconsin.
I graduated high school in Brentwood, TN, college at
Michigan Tech in Houghton, MI
([Da U.P.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan)),
and graduate school at GWU in our nation's capital.

I got my Ph.D. in order to become a professor like my role model, my
grandfather, the late Laird W. Heal
[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3A%22LW+Heal%22&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C47&as_vis=1").
  	  
I have 3 brothers, 1 sister, 2 cats, a wonderful wife
and 3 sweet children. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, jogging,
strength training, coding for fun, saunas, coffee,
long walks in the woods, swimming in lakes, meeting new people, and
spending time with my family.
