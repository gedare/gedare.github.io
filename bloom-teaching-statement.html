<!--CUT STYLE article--><!--CUT DEF section 1 --><p>I developed my pedagogy from experiences
guiding students through coding modules,
delivering lectures, attending teaching seminars, reading about learning,
and mentoring students.
<span style="font-weight:bold">My teaching style uses participatory lectures with guided discovery and
constructionist problem-solving assignments.</span>
My objective is to prepare students to
succeed post-graduation, and four primary goals guide my approach: </p><ol class="enumerate" type=1><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Cultivate student motivation.</span>
Intrinsic motivation can create life-long learners
who test better, stay in school, and are successful after
graduation&#XA0;[<a href="#deci_motivation_1991">3</a>].
Some methods I use to encourage motivation are to
dispel misconceptions&#XA0;[<a href="#demetriou_potential_2005">4</a>]
and to give meaning to efforts&#XA0;[<a href="#yeager_boring_2014">11</a>].
In addition to common misconceptions, computing majors face additional misconceptions, such as:
only men can do it, only geniuses can do it, the math is too hard,
if I do it well then I&#X2019;ll be a social outcast (nerd, geek),
programming is tedious non-creative work.
For example,
Mackenzie Morgan, an International Affairs major taking my computer organization lab,
was considering switching
majors to CS, but she was terrified of math.
I explained how math in CS differs from high school
math, and that I felt she would do well at it.
<span style="font-weight:bold">Next semester she told me that I
convinced her to become a CS major, but what I really did was dispel
her misconceptions and ease her fears.</span>
Mackenzie graduated with a BS in CS and now works in industry.<p>Na&#XEF;ve approaches to give meaning to students, such as telling them how
important learning is for their future, can be counter-productive.
One approach that works is to have students explain how
a course may be relevant to their
lives&#XA0;[<a href="#hulleman_enhancing_2010">7</a>].
Another approach that has worked well for me is to describe anecdotes of
former students, such as Irie Grant, who came to my office one day to tell
me that he was able to &#X201C;knock out the interviews and land the position at
Salesforce&#X201D; because they asked him to explain how threads and synchronization
work&#X2014;I like to tell this story on the second day of an OS class, just before
we introduce the process and threading model.</p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Improve teamwork with active learning.</span>
To improve teamwork skills needed in the working world, my classes include team projects,
<span style="font-weight:bold">which also increase student interest,
thus motivation&#XA0;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">[</span><a href="#ludi_introductory_2005">9</a><span style="font-weight:bold">]</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span>
The team projects I design give students breadth starting from a problem and
designing, implementing, testing, documenting, and presenting a solution.
Students learn about teamwork, team roles,
conflict resolution, and
version control&#XA0;[<a href="#lutz_undergraduate_2014">10</a>].
When possible, I prefer to form student teams by mixing students with
different backgrounds and strengths, which
the SCALE-UP&#XA0;[<a href="#beichner_student-centered_2007">1</a>] project has shown provides
measurable benefits in both small and large classes
to student understanding, attitude, problem solving,
and success, especially for
underrepresented groups.
Non-CS students have told me that working with CS majors provided new
insights into software design.
I try to mix better- and worse-performing students,
preferring to mix majors in cross-listed courses.
One non-CS student wrote these teams
&#X201C;worked wonders at keeping anyone from falling behind on the assignments.&#X201D;
Mixing students in teams works well, though some care must be taken for
grading and conflict resolution.
Open-source projects are another great way for students to get excited
about software and team-based development.
I have experimented with teaching 
open-source concepts that apply
my domain knowledge with RTEMS to benefit students.
I have guided students in learning research methods and
software engineering processes including
version control, code review&#X2014;which provides many
educational benefits&#XA0;[<a href="#guo_refining_2014">6</a>]&#X2013;and
collaborative software
(<em>e.g.</em>, instant messaging, wikis, Google Docs, GitHub).
Students have responded positively to my use of collaborative tools in class,
for example one student wrote she liked that I make myself
available &#X201C;throughout the final hours before a lab
assignment is due, allowing students the chance to work through last-minute
problems that might otherwise have defeated them.&#X201D;<p></p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Foster technical writing skills.</span>
I believe strongly in a &#X201C;writing in the disciplines (WID)&#X201D;
approach for improving students&#X2019; communication
skills&#XA0;[<a href="#kay_computer_1998">8</a>].
In all of my courses, I try to include the following WID coursework components:
a research-oriented team homework assignment with an oral and written report;
a summary and evaluation of a talk by a guest lecturer;
and a term project with a design document, oral presentation, and written
report.
I also encourage student blogs&#X2014;similar to
development process journals&#XA0;[<a href="#drexel_writing_1998">5</a>]&#X2014;for
writing about project design and implementation challenges.
<span style="font-weight:bold">I have found student-developer blogs are
useful to me for gauging understanding and progress,
and useful to students for self-reflection and report-writing.</span>
I plan to create and improve WID assignments to teach students
how to communicate technical content effectively.<p></p></li><li class="li-enumerate"><span style="font-weight:bold">Nurture students as research-scholars.</span>
Project-oriented courses are ideal for teaching students
about research methods, including how to ask good questions
and use the scientific method.
<span style="font-weight:bold">I encourage questions by acknowledging the value of any that are asked</span>,
and try to follow-up with more details by e-mail or class discussion board.
Although students benefit from learning the basic skills of research, those skills are not
teachable until students possess
deep background knowledge&#XA0;[<a href="#daniel_t._willingham_why_2009">2</a>].
Thus, I incorporate research methods
primarily in upper-division and graduate coursework.
When evaluating student work, I critique methods, analyses,
and presentation of results more than artifacts (code).
<span style="font-weight:bold">By providing students with the framework to conduct research, I 
give students the experience and skills needed to thrive in challenging jobs.</span>
For example,
a student in my OS lab,
Dan Fego, turned his team&#X2019;s OS term project into a senior design
capstone project. The team&#X2019;s
project took filesystem snapshots and supported roll-back of some file attributes.
Dan re-designed and extended the project to include support for more file
attributes and file contents. He later told me the experience&#X2014;especially
kernel hacking&#X2014;was instrumental
in helping land his first job.
</li></ol>
<!--TOC paragraph id="sec1" Summary-->
<h3 id="sec1" class="paragraph">Summary</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
The above principles serve to focus and guide my teaching.
Student successes like Mackenzie&#X2019;s, Dan&#X2019;s, and Irie&#X2019;s motivate me to become a better teacher, which I 
do by seeking advice, reading about
what works (and what does not), and evaluating my teaching efficacy through self-examination,
informal conversations with students, and anonymous feedback.</p><!--TOC section id="sec2" Course Interests-->
<h3 id="sec2" class="section">Course Interests</h3><!--SEC END --><p>
With my background in systems, I am capable and interested
in teaching courses with strong design and programming components.
I have taught architecture and OS courses with both CS and CE
students, so I am well-equipped to teach 
courses cross-listed or overlapping with computer engineering.
I am interested in teaching introductory courses
focusing on programming skills, software design, and computer organization,
as well as developing and teaching upper-division and graduate courses in 
computer architecture, operating systems, real-time and embedded systems,
and security.
I am also interested in developing two courses not normally in the curriculum,
one that explores the field of hardware cybersecurity,
and one that delves into cyber-physical system security.</p><!--TOC section id="sec3" References-->
