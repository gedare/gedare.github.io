	abstract = {We present a novel combination of hardware (architecture) and software (compiler) techniques to support the safe execution of untrusted code. While other efforts focus on isolating processes, our approach isolates code and data at a function (as in, C function) level, to enable fine-grained protection within a process as needed for downloaded plugins, libraries, andmodifications of open-source projects. Our solution also enforces timing restrictions to detect denial of service from untrusted code, and supports protection of dynamically allocated memory. Because bookkeeping data can become substantial (permission tables that at their finest granularity describe which memory words may be accessed by which functions), our solution employs a stack-structured bookkeeping mechanism that tracks the flow of execution and automatically dispenses with bookkeeping data when no longer needed. This approach also enables an architectural optimization to handle permissions for dynamically allocated memory, allowing heap blocks to be appropriately shared across the trust boundary. Tested across a suite of benchmarks, our solution had a worst case 12\% overhead and 3.5\% average overhead at the finest level of code granularity (every single function in its own unit of isolation). The overhead is easily reduced by using trace-driven analysis to combine functions into coarser-grained groups that share permissions.},

	abstract = {Integrated circuits (ICs) are often produced in foundries that lack effective security controls. In these foundries, sophisticated attackers are able to insert malicious Trojan circuits that are easily hidden in the large, complex circuitry that comprises modern ICs. These so-called Trojan circuits are capable of launching attacks directly in hardware, or, more deviously, can facilitate software attacks. Current defense against Trojan circuits consists of statistical detection techniques to find such circuits before product deployment. The fact that statistical detection can result in false negatives raises the obvious questions: can attacks be detected post-deployment, and is secure execution nonetheless possible using chips with undetected Trojan circuits? In this paper we present the Secure Heartbeat And Dual-Encryption (SHADE) architecture, a compiler–hardware solution for detecting and preventing a subset of Trojan circuit attacks in deployed systems. Two layers of hardware encryption are combined with a heartbeat of off-chip accesses to provide a secure execution environment using untrusted hardware. The SHADE system is designed to complement pre-deployment detection techniques and to add a final, last-chance layer of security.

	abstract = {Much of modern software development consists of assembling together existing software components and writing the glue code that integrates them into a unified application. The term COTS-Based System (CBS) is often used to describe such applications, for which the components assembled are understood to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time, pure-binary libraries incorporated at load-time, and plugins that are loaded into the application at execution time by the user.Because components have access to system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted platform for managing components and their interactions?We present an architecture that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses or denial-of-service) and enables applications to undertake a hardware-supervised recovery procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware.},

	abstract = {Hardware support can reduce the time spent operating on data structures by exploiting circuit-level parallelism. Such hardware data structures (HWDSs) can reduce the latency and jitter of data structure operations, which can benefit real-time systems by reducing worst-case execution times (WCETs). For example, a hardware priority queue (HWPQ) can enqueue and dequeue prioritized items in constant time with low variance; the best software implementations are in logarithmic-time asymptotic complexity for at least one of the enqueue or dequeue operations. The main problems with HWDSs are the limited size of hardware and the complexity of sharing it. In this paper we show that software support can help circumvent the size and sharing limitations of hardware so that applications can benefit from a HWDS. We evaluate our work by showing how the choice of software or hardware affects schedulability of task sets that use multiple priority queues of varying sizes. We model task behavior on two applications that are important in real-time and embedded domains: the grey-weighted distance transform for topology mapping and Dijkstra's algorithm for GPS navigation. Our results indicate that HWDSs can reduce the WCET of applications even when a HWDS is shared by multiple data structures or when data structure sizes exceed HWDS size constraints.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores cyber-physical system security as it relates to computer hardware. Cyber-physical systems must ensure that physical compromises do not automatically lead to cyber compromises. Attacks on the processor supply chain represent a serious threat to cyber-physical systems – more so than servers and desktops – because critical control systems rely on hardware's trustworthiness, without which catastrophe would result: trains, planes, and automobiles crashing, satellites failing, unmanned robots running amok – think of any real-time or embedded system and you will find a piece of hardware whose correctness and security is assumed implicitly. We discuss supply chain security for the design and fabrication of processor hardware in Section 12.2. Physical compromise of fielded devices offers an attacker with unique opportunities for studying, copying, and corrupting components of a cyber-physical system. If the hardware does not protect itself and its software, then little can be done against a sufficiently motivated and resourceful attack. In Section 12.3, we examine how hardware helps make software secure and consider in particular the challenging aspects of computer security for devices that are not physically secured.

Many planning algorithms exist today to produce plans given a problem definition and goal. To ease programmability of autonomous systems, many languages have been developed for defining problems and goals. However, planning algorithms tend to need to be customized not only for the problem definition language, but also for the problem definition itself. This work presents a new problem definition language called PyLOM, an interpreted, object-oriented language. The PyLOM run-time system uses generic algorithms, which do not need to be customized for each problem definition. Thus, PyLOM separates problem definitions from planning algorithms to ease programmability and software reuse. The choice of an object-oriented language also is intended to aid programmability, since prior problem definition languages adopt a functional programming style.},

Useful RTOS features include real-time thread scheduling, thread communication, synchronization, interrupt handling, memory management, file systems, device drivers, networking, and debugging support. The Real-Time Executive for Multi-processor Systems (RTEMS) is a free and open-source RTOS that supports over a dozen processor architecture families and over 150 embedded system boards. RTEMS is designed to support embedded applications with stringent real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX. RTEMS includes optional services such as TCP/IP networking and file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations. One of the primary functions of an RTOS is to select threads that can obtain access to resources such as shared memory and processor time. RTEMS uses multiple algorithms to manage both waiting threads and those ready to execute. The thread execution schedulers include the traditional RTOS round robin and deterministic priority schedulers, rate monotonic, earliest deadline first (EDF), constant bandwidth server (CBS), and simple SMP scheduling algorithms. The RTEMS scheduling framework allows the application developer to select the thread scheduling algorithm that best meets the application's space and time requirements. ÂăWe will present how this framework can be used by researchers to integrate their own scheduling algorithm into RTEMS and test it using a scheduling simulator before deploying it on target hardware.},

Role-based access control (RBAC) eases administrative complexity for large-scale access control, while a client-server model can ease performance bottlenecks by distributing access enforcement across multiple servers that consult the centralized access decision policy server as needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach to access enforcement using an existing associative array hardware data structure (HWDS) to cache authorizations in a distributed system using RBAC. This HWDS approach uses hardware that has previous been demonstrated as useful for several application domains including access control, network packet routing, and generic comparison-based integer search algorithms. We reproduce experiments from prior work on distributed access enforcement for RBAC systems, and we design and conduct new experiments to evaluate HWDS-based access enforcement. Experimental data show the HWDS cuts session initiation time by about a third compared to existing solutions, while achieving similar performance to authorize access requests. These results suggest that distributed systems using RBAC could use HWDS-based access enforcement to increase session throughput or to decrease the number of access enforcement servers without losing performance.},

SuperGlue decreases the amount of recovery code system designers need to implement by an order of magnitude, and replaces it with declarative specifications. We evaluate SuperGlue with a fault injection campaign in low-level system components (e.g., memory mapping manager and scheduler). Additionally, we evaluate the performance of SuperGlue in a web-server application. Results show that SuperGlue improves system reliability with only a small performance degradation of 11.84\%.},

We propose a novel approach for an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC) to ensure confidentiality of trusted software despite hardware Trojan attacks. Our approach employs defensive techniques that feature morphing on-chip resources for moving target defense against fabrication-time Trojans, onion-encryption for confidentiality, and replication of functionally-equivalent variants of processing elements with arbitrated voting for resilience to design-time Trojans. These techniques are enabled by partial runtime reconfiguration (PRR) and are managed by a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that reduces developer burden. We call our approach the Morph Onion-encryption Replication PRR HAL, or MORPH. MORPH aims to provide a stable interface for embedded systems developers to use in deploying applications that are resilient to hardware Trojans.},

Quarantine's core feature is the ability to fork a protection domain on-the-fly to isolate a specific principal's execution of untrusted code without risk of a compromise spreading. Forking enables the OS to ensure service continuity by permitting even high-risk operations to proceed, albeit subject to greater scrutiny and constraints. Quarantine even partitions executing threads that share resources into isolated protection domains. We discuss the design and implementation of quarantine within the LockDown OS, a security-focused evolution of the Composite component-based microkernel OS. Initial performance results for quarantine show that about 98\% of the overhead comes from the cost of copying memory to the new protection domain.},

System-wide memory management must consider not only allocation to single processes, but also efficient sharing of data across protection domains, and the allocation of memory based on the performance of applications that span multiple protection domains. This paper introduces the CBuf system for the global management of virtual and physical memory, including zero-copy sharing between protection domains. We present the design and implementation of both garbage collection techniques to enable efficient sharing, and policies that balance memory between protection domains specifically to satisfy system and application constraints such as quality of service. We show that a CBuf-enabled webserver achieves over a factor of 2.5 throughput speedup while using less processing time than Apache on Linux, and that the system can intentionally control system throughput through intelligent memory allocation.},

In this paper, a number of techniques are taken into account for notifying events in such a kind of systems, and their performance has been evaluated. Besides conventional CAN, a recent proposal for extending this protocol, termed CAN XR, is considered. Moreover, the adoption of Bloom filters to cope with rare events in very large systems has also been evaluated.},

This paper describes how CAN XR, a recently proposed extension of the CAN data-link layer, can effectively support the distributed calculation of arbitrary binary Boolean functions, which are the foundation of most security protocols, without necessarily disclosing their operands on the bus. The feasibility of the approach is then shown through experimental evaluation and by confirming its applicability to a shared key generation protocol proposed in literature.},

The numerous heterogeneous connected devices that exist throughout the IoT system creates new security and privacy concerns. Some of these concerns can be overcome through trust, transparency, and integrity, which can be achieved with data provenance. Data provenance, also known as data lineage, provides a history of transformations that occurs on a data object from the time it was created to its current state. Data provenance has been explored in the areas of scientific computing, business, forensic analysis, and intrusion detection. Data provenance can help in detecting and mitigating malicious cyber attacks. In this paper, we explore the integration of provenance within the IoT. We introduce Provenance Aware Internet of Things System (PAIoTS), a provenance collection framework for IoT devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by developing a prototype system for proof of concept.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast collection of interconnected sensors, devices, and services that share data and information over the Internet with the objective of leveraging multiple information sources to optimize related systems. The technologies associated with the IoT have significantly improved the quality of many existing applications by reducing costs, improving functionality, increasing access to resources, and enhancing automation. The adoption of IoT by industries has led to the next industrial revolution: Industry 4.0. The rise of the Industrial IoT (IIoT) promises to enhance factory management, process optimization, worker safety, and more. However, the rollout of the IIoT is not without significant issues, and many of these act as major barriers that prevent fully achieving the vision of Industry 4.0. One major area of concern is the security and privacy of the massive datasets that are captured and stored, which may leak information about intellectual property, trade secrets, and other competitive knowledge. As a way forward toward solving security and privacy concerns, we aim in this paper to identify common input-output (I/O) design patterns that exist in applications of the IIoT. These design patterns enable constructing an abstract model representation of data flow semantics used by such applications, and therefore better understand how to secure the information related to IIoT operations. In this paper, we describe communication protocols and identify common I/O design patterns for IIoT applications with an emphasis on data flow in edge devices, which, in the industrial control system (ICS) setting, are most often involved in process control or monitoring.},

	abstract = {In "BUNDLE: Real-Time Multi-Threaded Scheduling to Reduce Cache Contention" Tessler and Fisher present a positive perspective of instruction caches for hard real-time multithreaded tasks. The thread-aware scheduling algorithm limits the execution of threads to sets of instructions that cannot result in cache conflicts. Identification of these sets result in conflict free regions which are used to identify scheduling groups called bundles in the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm. Placement of a thread in a particular bundle depends on, what the authors call, "anticipating execution". However, they do not define a complete mechanism to anticipate execution. In this work, we propose a method to anticipate execution that modifies cache hardware and introduces a new interrupt raised prior to a cache conflict. This new interrupt is combined with (a slightly modified version of) the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm. The intent is to implement these hardware modifications for ARM on the gem5 simulator with the scheduling algorithm integrated into the RTEMS operating system. The hope is this work serves as further motivation to bring the positive perspective of caches to physical processors and operating systems.},

However, these existing methods may struggle to handle variable time intervals between messages during transitions of vehicle driving modes. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective method to ensure the security of the CAN bus that is based on constant message frequencies across vehicle driving modes. This proposed method does not require any modifications on the existing CAN bus and it is designed with the intent for efficient execution in platforms with very limited computational resources.

These devices communicate through the in-vehicle network for enhanced safety and comfort but are vulnerable to cyber-physical risks and attacks. A well-known technique of detecting these attacks and unusual events is by using intrusion detection systems. Anomalies in the network occur at unknown points and produce abrupt changes in the statistical features of the message stream. In this paper, we propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection approach using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) change-point detection algorithm to detect data injection attacks on the controller area network (CAN) bus. We leverage the parameters required for the change-point algorithm to reduce false alarm rate and detection delay. Using real dataset generated from a car in normal operation, we evaluate our detection approach on three different kinds of attack scenarios.},

	doi = {10.1109/RTAS.2019.00017},
	abstract = {Schedule randomization is one of the recently introduced security defenses against schedule-based attacks, i.e., attacks whose success depends on a particular ordering between the execution window of an attacker and a victim task within the system. It falls into the category of information hiding (as opposed to deterministic isolation-based defenses) and is designed to reduce the attacker's ability to infer the future schedule. This paper aims to investigate the limitations and vulnerabilities of schedule randomization-based defenses in real-time systems. We first provide definitions, categorization, and examples of schedule-based attacks, and then discuss the challenges of employing schedule randomization in real-time systems. Further, we provide a preliminary security test to determine whether a certain timing relation between the attacker and victim tasks will never happen in systems scheduled by a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm. Finally, we compare fixed-priority scheduling against schedule-randomization techniques in terms of the success rate of various schedule-based attacks for both synthetic and real-world applications. Our results show that, in many cases, schedule randomization either has no security benefits or can even increase the success rate of the attacker depending on the priority relation between the attacker and victim tasks.},

The CAN bus does not implement a security protocol that can protect the vehicle against the increasing cyber and physical attacks. To address this risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected from two passenger cars and on an open-source CAN dataset collected from real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data injection attacks with low false positive rates. Over four real attack scenarios from the open-source dataset, SAIDuCANT observes at most one false positive before detecting an attack whereas other detection approaches using CAN timing features detect on average more than a hundred false positives before a real attack occurs.},

Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing 100s of millions of lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly-integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrate effective security. We describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves throughout the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine the quality of the machine learning output.},

	abstract = {Increased access to space has led to an increase in the usage of commodity processors in radiation environments. These processors are vulnerable to transient faults such as single event upsets that may cause bit-flips in processor components. Caches in particular are vulnerable due to their relatively large area, yet are often omitted from fault injection testing because many processors do not provide direct access to cache contents and they are often not fully modeled by simulators. The performance benefits of caches make disabling them undesirable, and the presence of error correcting codes is insufficient to correct for increasingly common multiple bit upsets. This work explores building a program’s cache profile by collecting cache usage information at an instruction granularity via commonly available on-chip debugging interfaces. The profile provides a tighter bound than cache utilization for cache vulnerability estimates (50\% for several benchmarks). This can be applied to reduce the number of fault injections required to characterize behavior by at least two-thirds for the benchmarks we examine. The profile enables future work in hardware fault injection for caches that avoids the biases of existing techniques.},

As such, research has turned to machine learning to automate malware detection and malware family classification. Existing work extracts and engineers static and dynamic features from the malware sample to train classifiers. Despite promising results, such techniques assume that the analyst has access to the malware executable file. Self-deleting malware invalidates this assumption and requires analysts to find forensic evidence of malware execution for further analysis. In this paper, we present and evaluate an approach to detecting malware that executed on a Windows target and further classify the malware into its associated family to provide semantic insight. Specifically, we engineer features from the Windows prefetch file, a file system forensic artifact that archives process information. Results show that it is possible to detect the malicious artifact with 99\% accuracy; furthermore, classifying the malware into a fine-grained family has comparable performance to techniques that require access to the original executable. We also provide a thorough security discussion of the proposed approach against adversarial diversity.},

Furthermore, we prove that the payback period to recoup this initial startup cost is always at least as long as the initial unprofitable startup interval, and we show numerically that it can be substantially longer.

Meanwhile different data models have evolved over time, each providing a different set of features to classify attacks. Defenders have limited time to retrain classifiers, while the scale of data and feature mismatch between data models can affect the ability to periodically retrain. Much work has focused on classification accuracy yet feature selection is a key part of machine learning that, when optimized, reduces the training time and can increase accuracy by removing poorly performing features that introduce noise. With a larger feature space, the pursuit of more features is not as valuable as selecting better features. In this paper, we use an ensemble approach of filter methods to rank features followed by a voting technique to select a subset of features. We evaluate our approach using three datasets to show that, across datasets and network topologies, similar features have a trivial effect on classifier accuracy after removal. Our approach identifies poorly performing features to remove in a classifier-agnostic manner that can significantly save time for periodic retraining of production NIDS.},

	abstract = {The secure functioning of automotive systems is vital to the safety of their passengers and other roadway users. One of the critical functions for safety is the controller area network (CAN), which interconnects the safety-critical electronic control units (ECUs) in the majority of ground vehicles. Unfortunately CAN is known to be vulnerable to several attacks. One such attack is the bus-off attack, which can be used to cause a victim ECU to disconnect itself from the CAN bus and, subsequently, for an attacker to masquerade as that ECU. A limitation of the bus-off attack is that it requires the attacker to achieve tight synchronization between the transmission of the victim and the attacker’s injected message. In this paper, we introduce a schedule-based attack framework for the CAN bus-off attack that uses the real-time schedule of the CAN bus to predict more attack opportunities than previously known. We describe a ranking method for an attacker to select and optimize its attack injections with respect to criteria such as attack success rate, bus perturbation, or attack latency. The results show that vulnerabilities of the CAN bus can be enhanced by schedulebased attacks.},

	abstract = {The open-source and community-supported gem5 simulator is one of the most popular tools for computer architecture research. This simulation infrastructure allows researchers to model modern computer hardware at the cycle level, and it has enough fidelity to boot unmodified Linux-based operating systems and run full applications for multiple architectures including x86, Arm, and RISC-V. The gem5 simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the original gem5 release. In this time, there have been over 7500 commits to the codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality. In this paper, we give and overview of gem5's usage and features, describe the current state of the gem5 simulator, and enumerate the major changes since the initial release of gem5. We also discuss how the gem5 simulator has transitioned to a formal governance model to enable continued improvement and community support for the next 20 years of computer architecture research.},

	abstract = {In proposed path-aware designs for the Internet, end hosts can select which path their packets use. What criteria should the end hosts use to select paths? Recent work has proposed path-aware access control frameworks in which routing nodes publicly report their knowledge of the security postures of other nodes; end hosts can then base their routing choices on these reports. However, nothing is known regarding the nodes’ incentives to report their knowledge truthfully. In this paper, we consider the case in which each network node is strategic, and seeks to craft its public reports to manipulate traffic patterns in its own favor. In the context of a simple selfish routing problem with two strategic nodes, we show that for a wide swath of the parameter space, each node has a dominant reporting strategy, meaning that its individually optimal strategy does not depend on the strategy of the other node. These dominant strategies are generally not truthful. At the resulting dominant-strategy Nash equilibrium, we show that the expected social cost is (often considerably) higher than that achieved when both nodes are completely truthful. Nonetheless, we prove that these equilibrium reporting strategies are never perverse, meaning that their resulting social cost is never worse than if traffic were uninformed as to network state.},

While this popular software architecture paradigm has many advantages in development and deployment, it also introduces a wider attack surface that is vulnerable to both internal and external attackers. Potentially malicious third-party services or software packages, as well as increased communication endpoints, introduce a wide array of security concerns. To improve the resiliency of microservice-based applications, many of which store sensitive data, we propose a novel, path-based anomaly detection and access control infrastructure that requires no modifications to existing software. We propose leveraging trusted proxies deployed alongside each service for request inspection, anomaly detection and signed token propagation for end-user path validation. Our approach reduces the trusted computing base away from the microservices to a smaller set of components that allow for less trust and a smaller attack surface.},

	abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) dominates in-vehicle networking systems in modern vehicles. CAN was designed with low-latency and reliability as key features. Authenticity of a CAN frame was not considered in the design, thus, most in-vehicle network nodes inherently trust received messages as coming from a legitimate source. As a result, it is trivial to program (or hack) a network node to spoof traffic. Authentication is challenging for CAN and related protocols, such as SAE J1939, due to limited frame sizes and high bus utilization. Adding a message authentication code (MAC) as a separate message can unduly stress the real-time delivery of safety-critical messages. Although this stressor is well-known, the impact of authentication protocols on real-time message delivery in CAN has not yet been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of real-time schedulability analysis applied to authentication schemes for CAN, CAN Flexible Data-rate (CAN FD), and CAN extra long payload (CAN XL). We formulate the response time analysis for addition of MACs and periodic transmission of MACs, and we examine their impact on two case studies and through evaluation with randomized schedulability experiments over a wide range of message sets.},

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as industrial control systems, automobiles, and medical devices often consist of applications with real-time properties. Due to the safety-critical nature of the application domain, multiple security and fault tolerance approaches have been studied and used in safety-critical CPS. One of the popular approaches for CPS safety is the Simplex architecture, which has also been used recently to strengthen the security of the CPS. The simplex architecture supports the integration of safe controllers for dependable systems, and when combined with periodic restarts, the architecture can reset the CPS into a safe state after each restart. However, these restart-based systems do not protect the system against attacks that persist beyond a restart. Such attacks can be mitigated using secure boot, which is a widely used approach for securing general computing systems but is not used in real-time systems due to the overhead of the boot process. This paper presents an analytical framework and derives feasibility conditions to enable secure reboots in real-time applications. The schedulability conditions presented can be used to design and integrate secure reboot into Simplex-based CPS. Our analysis shows that secure boot adds a deterministic and low-performance overhead, which can be as low as 0.08\%.},

IoV is a distributed network that aids in handling the data generated by vehicular sensors and vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X), thus enabling novel applications such as autonomous driving and platooning while increasing safety and energy efficiency. In IoV, the sensors and the interdependent devices relay critical information for the efficient implementation of real-time applications in the ecosystem. Despite all these advancements, a vital challenge is establishing smooth communication among interconnected devices, concretely, interoperability in the IoV—a deceptively simple notion that is not yet fully addressed to achieve a fully integrated ecosystem. This is mainly because the networked domains, such as home, grid, and health care, are developed in silos, operating independently with diverse processes and protocols. Hence, seamless exchange of information is yet to be achieved across the ecosystem, hindering the maximization of the full promise of IoV. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the present state of interoperability and comprehensively survey the challenges in IoV. We present a taxonomy of interoperability approaches, review solutions that prior work have proposed, and provide insights on how to address the current challenges. Finally, we identify open problems that persist and future directions for research.},

Specifically, we examine the features' vulnerabilities and evaluate their robustness against concept drift. We curated a novel dataset that simulates the manipulations that attackers may invoke on malware samples. We demonstrate improved robustness to concept drift over traditional API call-based features by training machine learning classifiers on malware collected in the wild, and testing the classifiers against samples that underwent manipulations. Further, we investigate time decay due to concept drift using temporally consistent evaluations that do not assume access to newer information. The evaluation shows that our features are robust against malware obfuscation. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate how malware labeling conventions (malware type or family) can affect results, and make recommendations for dataset construction.},

	abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and solutions into passenger vehicles has transformed cars into a complex system with intelligence and a platform for extending information technology possibilities. These devices communicate through in-vehicle networks that use the controller area network (CAN) as a de facto standard for the safety-critical functionality of the vehicles. One creative exploit against CAN is the bus-off attack, which uses the fault tolerance capabilities of the CAN bus to coerce a victim electronic control unit (ECU) into the bus-off state from which it is not allowed to access the bus. As a result, the victim ECU is unable to send or receive messages. The WeepingCAN attack is a stealthy variation of the bus-off attack that reduces its observability and therefore the effectiveness of detection-based mitigation. In this paper, we introduce three software-based improvements that greatly increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the WeepingCAN attack. First, we introduce a novel zero-phase approach for synchronizing the attack. Second, we discover an alternative approach to disable retransmissions, which is a key capability of WeepingCAN, that allows the attack to be conducted from more ECUs than before. Third, we identify a transitive attack strategy that enables an attacker to target many more ECUs than originally possible. We evaluate our improvements experimentally using a CAN benchmark and find that the zero-phase synchronization improves the attack success rate from 75\% to over 90\% and the transitive attack strategy enables all the ECUs in the benchmark to be attacked.},

Unlike traditional ransomware attacks, ransomware in IoT-based attacks aims to affect functionality rather than the availability of data, thus defeating traditional detection methods. To address this issue, this article introduces a lightweight intrusion detection system, L-IDS. It is designed based on the principle of defense in depth and combines multilayer controls, hardware-enhanced TEE such as TrustZone, with machine learning (ML) algorithms. L-IDS can effectively detect and mitigate ransomware attacks inside IoT systems with low resources compared to traditional security scanning methods. By integrating TEE, L-IDS will enhance the security and protection of IoT devices, while ML algorithms will help detect ransomware attacks more efficiently and accurately. Overall, the proposed approach provides a promising solution for protecting IoT systems against ransomware attacks, especially for resource-constrained devices.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has transformed everyday consumer objects into interconnected, intelligent devices. Due to historically weak security designs, these devices are susceptible to compromises with far-reaching consequences. This paper aims to evaluate the current state of IoT device firmware security and assess the effectiveness of existing methods in safeguarding sensitive data. We conducted a manual analysis of 16 IoT devices, revealing a range of firmware management techniques, each varying in their effectiveness against an evil maid attack scenario. Out of the 16 devices, only 2 showed evidence of encrypting data at rest, despite 10 having crypto-enabled hardware. Additionally, 9 out of 16 devices possessed secure boot-enabled hardware, but 4 of them did not properly utilize or implement secure boot. Consequently, 13 devices were identified as vulnerable to sensitive data compromise, and 11 were at risk of firmware modification attacks. To address these critical security gaps, this study proposes a method for analyzing data-at-rest encryption and secure boot status in IoT devices. In this paper we shed light on the prevailing security shortcomings and provide practical analysis techniques to foster improved IoT device security and user data protection.},

	abstract = {Vehicle platooning is a key application for intelligent transportation systems that brings the joint problem of maintaining safety and security as prioritized requirements. The complex and dynamic electromagnetic environment coupled with sophisticated adversarial threats motivate better understanding of platoon control resilience from traditional faults, disturbances, and attack injects. An open problem for this understanding is the impact that information flow (communication network) topologies have on the attack and defense strategies for vehicular platoons. As the topology changes, vulnerability amongst platoon members and their individual contributions to the overall platoon security also change. This paper evaluates the impact of member-specific targeting informed by topology and demonstrates that targeting one member over another can be advantageous to the attacker. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy to identify topologies by key characteristics as an option for an industry standard.},

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has significantly increased the interconnectivity of everyday activities. Malware on IoT devices directly jeopardize the security and privacy of their users, and device heterogeneity poses significant challenges in malware analysis. This paper presents Cimalir, which uses an automated approach for clustering malware that leverages an intermediate representation (IR) of low-level assembly code across different architectures. Cimalir uses a staged analysis approach that first filters binary images using set-based similarity of function attributes before applying call graph analysis. Additionally, Cimalir employs a string based technique to distinguish different malware families that exhibit a substantial level of shared code use. Cimalir has a low runtime complexity as evidenced by a linear relationship between execution time and the number of functions in the binary images under analysis. Experimental results show that Cimalir yields improved clustering results compared to the state-of-the-art binary analysis tool, BinDiff, when applied to malware binaries compiled for different instruction sets. Cimalir results in a DBCV score of 0.75 and Silhouette Score of 0.812 when clustering malware families from the CUBE-MALIOT-2021 dataset. In comparison, BinDiff achieves scores of 0.54 and 0.616, respectively. This indicates Cimalir’s superior performance compared to BinDiff.},
