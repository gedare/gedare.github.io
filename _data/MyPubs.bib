	abstract = {We present a novel combination of hardware (architecture) and software (compiler) techniques to support the safe execution of untrusted code. While other efforts focus on isolating processes, our approach isolates code and data at a function (as in, C function) level, to enable fine-grained protection within a process as needed for downloaded plugins, libraries, andmodifications of open-source projects. Our solution also enforces timing restrictions to detect denial of service from untrusted code, and supports protection of dynamically allocated memory. Because bookkeeping data can become substantial (permission tables that at their finest granularity describe which memory words may be accessed by which functions), our solution employs a stack-structured bookkeeping mechanism that tracks the flow of execution and automatically dispenses with bookkeeping data when no longer needed. This approach also enables an architectural optimization to handle permissions for dynamically allocated memory, allowing heap blocks to be appropriately shared across the trust boundary. Tested across a suite of benchmarks, our solution had a worst case 12\% overhead and 3.5\% average overhead at the finest level of code granularity (every single function in its own unit of isolation). The overhead is easily reduced by using trace-driven analysis to combine functions into coarser-grained groups that share permissions.},

	abstract = {Integrated circuits (ICs) are often produced in foundries that lack effective security controls. In these foundries, sophisticated attackers are able to insert malicious Trojan circuits that are easily hidden in the large, complex circuitry that comprises modern ICs. These so-called Trojan circuits are capable of launching attacks directly in hardware, or, more deviously, can facilitate software attacks. Current defense against Trojan circuits consists of statistical detection techniques to find such circuits before product deployment. The fact that statistical detection can result in false negatives raises the obvious questions: can attacks be detected post-deployment, and is secure execution nonetheless possible using chips with undetected Trojan circuits? In this paper we present the Secure Heartbeat And Dual-Encryption (SHADE) architecture, a compilerâ€“hardware solution for detecting and preventing a subset of Trojan circuit attacks in deployed systems. Two layers of hardware encryption are combined with a heartbeat of off-chip accesses to provide a secure execution environment using untrusted hardware. The SHADE system is designed to complement pre-deployment detection techniques and to add a final, last-chance layer of security.

The term COTS-Based System (CBS) is often used to describe such applications, for which the components assembled are understood to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time, pure-binary libraries incorporated at load-time, and plugins that are loaded into the application at execution time by the user.Because components have access to system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted platform for managing components and their interactions?We present an architecture that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses or denial-of-service) and enables applications to undertake a hardware-supervised recovery procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware.},

The operating system produces liveness checks, embedded in the software clock, to which the guard can respond. We also present a novel method for the OS to detect a hardware-software (HW/SW) Trojan privilege escalation attack by using OS-generated checks to test if the CPU hardware is enforcing memory protection (MP).

	abstract = {Hardware support can reduce the time spent operating on data structures by exploiting circuit-level parallelism. Such hardware data structures (HWDSs) can reduce the latency and jitter of data structure operations, which can benefit real-time systems by reducing worst-case execution times (WCETs). For example, a hardware priority queue (HWPQ) can enqueue and dequeue prioritized items in constant time with low variance; the best software implementations are in logarithmic-time asymptotic complexity for at least one of the enqueue or dequeue operations. The main problems with HWDSs are the limited size of hardware and the complexity of sharing it. In this paper we show that software support can help circumvent the size and sharing limitations of hardware so that applications can benefit from a HWDS. We evaluate our work by showing how the choice of software or hardware affects schedulability of task sets that use multiple priority queues of varying sizes. We model task behavior on two applications that are important in real-time and embedded domains: the grey-weighted distance transform for topology mapping and Dijkstra's algorithm for GPS navigation. Our results indicate that HWDSs can reduce the WCET of applications even when a HWDS is shared by multiple data structures or when data structure sizes exceed HWDS size constraints.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores cyber-physical system security as it relates to computer hardware. Cyber-physical systems must ensure that physical compromises do not automatically lead to cyber compromises. Attacks on the processor supply chain represent a serious threat to cyber-physical systems â€“ more so than servers and desktops â€“ because critical control systems rely on hardware's trustworthiness, without which catastrophe would result: trains, planes, and automobiles crashing, satellites failing, unmanned robots running amok â€“ think of any real-time or embedded system and you will find a piece of hardware whose correctness and security is assumed implicitly. We discuss supply chain security for the design and fabrication of processor hardware in Section 12.2. Physical compromise of fielded devices offers an attacker with unique opportunities for studying, copying, and corrupting components of a cyber-physical system. If the hardware does not protect itself and its software, then little can be done against a sufficiently motivated and resourceful attack. In Section 12.3, we examine how hardware helps make software secure and consider in particular the challenging aspects of computer security for devices that are not physically secured.

Many planning algorithms exist today to produce plans given a problem definition and goal. To ease programmability of autonomous systems, many languages have been developed for defining problems and goals. However, planning algorithms tend to need to be customized not only for the problem definition language, but also for the problem definition itself. This work presents a new problem definition language called PyLOM, an interpreted, object-oriented language. The PyLOM run-time system uses generic algorithms, which do not need to be customized for each problem definition. Thus, PyLOM separates problem definitions from planning algorithms to ease programmability and software reuse. The choice of an object-oriented language also is intended to aid programmability, since prior problem definition languages adopt a functional programming style.},

Useful RTOS features include real-time thread scheduling, thread communication, synchronization, interrupt handling, memory management, file systems, device drivers, networking, and debugging support. The Real-Time Executive for Multi-processor Systems (RTEMS) is a free and open-source RTOS that supports over a dozen processor architecture families and over 150 embedded system boards. RTEMS is designed to support embedded applications with stringent real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX. RTEMS includes optional services such as TCP/IP networking and file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations. One of the primary functions of an RTOS is to select threads that can obtain access to resources such as shared memory and processor time. RTEMS uses multiple algorithms to manage both waiting threads and those ready to execute. The thread execution schedulers include the traditional RTOS round robin and deterministic priority schedulers, rate monotonic, earliest deadline first (EDF), constant bandwidth server (CBS), and simple SMP scheduling algorithms. The RTEMS scheduling framework allows the application developer to select the thread scheduling algorithm that best meets the application's space and time requirements. Ã‚ÄƒWe will present how this framework can be used by researchers to integrate their own scheduling algorithm into RTEMS and test it using a scheduling simulator before deploying it on target hardware.},

Role-based access control (RBAC) eases administrative complexity for large-scale access control, while a client-server model can ease performance bottlenecks by distributing access enforcement across multiple servers that consult the centralized access decision policy server as needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach to access enforcement using an existing associative array hardware data structure (HWDS) to cache authorizations in a distributed system using RBAC. This HWDS approach uses hardware that has previous been demonstrated as useful for several application domains including access control, network packet routing, and generic comparison-based integer search algorithms. We reproduce experiments from prior work on distributed access enforcement for RBAC systems, and we design and conduct new experiments to evaluate HWDS-based access enforcement. Experimental data show the HWDS cuts session initiation time by about a third compared to existing solutions, while achieving similar performance to authorize access requests. These results suggest that distributed systems using RBAC could use HWDS-based access enforcement to increase session throughput or to decrease the number of access enforcement servers without losing performance.},

SuperGlue decreases the amount of recovery code system designers need to implement by an order of magnitude, and replaces it with declarative specifications. We evaluate SuperGlue with a fault injection campaign in low-level system components (e.g., memory mapping manager and scheduler). Additionally, we evaluate the performance of SuperGlue in a web-server application. Results show that SuperGlue improves system reliability with only a small performance degradation of 11.84\%.},

We propose a novel approach for an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC) to ensure confidentiality of trusted software despite hardware Trojan attacks. Our approach employs defensive techniques that feature morphing on-chip resources for moving target defense against fabrication-time Trojans, onion-encryption for confidentiality, and replication of functionally-equivalent variants of processing elements with arbitrated voting for resilience to design-time Trojans. These techniques are enabled by partial runtime reconfiguration (PRR) and are managed by a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that reduces developer burden. We call our approach the Morph Onion-encryption Replication PRR HAL, or MORPH. MORPH aims to provide a stable interface for embedded systems developers to use in deploying applications that are resilient to hardware Trojans.},

Quarantine's core feature is the ability to fork a protection domain on-the-fly to isolate a specific principal's execution of untrusted code without risk of a compromise spreading. Forking enables the OS to ensure service continuity by permitting even high-risk operations to proceed, albeit subject to greater scrutiny and constraints. Quarantine even partitions executing threads that share resources into isolated protection domains. We discuss the design and implementation of quarantine within the LockDown OS, a security-focused evolution of the Composite component-based microkernel OS. Initial performance results for quarantine show that about 98\% of the overhead comes from the cost of copying memory to the new protection domain.},

System-wide memory management must consider not only allocation to single processes, but also efficient sharing of data across protection domains, and the allocation of memory based on the performance of applications that span multiple protection domains. This paper introduces the CBuf system for the global management of virtual and physical memory, including zero-copy sharing between protection domains. We present the design and implementation of both garbage collection techniques to enable efficient sharing, and policies that balance memory between protection domains specifically to satisfy system and application constraints such as quality of service. We show that a CBuf-enabled webserver achieves over a factor of 2.5 throughput speedup while using less processing time than Apache on Linux, and that the system can intentionally control system throughput through intelligent memory allocation.},

In this paper, a number of techniques are taken into account for notifying events in such a kind of systems, and their performance has been evaluated. Besides conventional CAN, a recent proposal for extending this protocol, termed CAN XR, is considered. Moreover, the adoption of Bloom filters to cope with rare events in very large systems has also been evaluated.},

This paper describes how CAN XR, a recently proposed extension of the CAN data-link layer, can effectively support the distributed calculation of arbitrary binary Boolean functions, which are the foundation of most security protocols, without necessarily disclosing their operands on the bus. The feasibility of the approach is then shown through experimental evaluation and by confirming its applicability to a shared key generation protocol proposed in literature.},

The numerous heterogeneous connected devices that exist throughout the IoT system creates new security and privacy concerns. Some of these concerns can be overcome through trust, transparency, and integrity, which can be achieved with data provenance. Data provenance, also known as data lineage, provides a history of transformations that occurs on a data object from the time it was created to its current state. Data provenance has been explored in the areas of scientific computing, business, forensic analysis, and intrusion detection. Data provenance can help in detecting and mitigating malicious cyber attacks. In this paper, we explore the integration of provenance within the IoT. We introduce Provenance Aware Internet of Things System (PAIoTS), a provenance collection framework for IoT devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by developing a prototype system for proof of concept.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast collection of interconnected sensors, devices, and services that share data and information over the Internet with the objective of leveraging multiple information sources to optimize related systems. The technologies associated with the IoT have significantly improved the quality of many existing applications by reducing costs, improving functionality, increasing access to resources, and enhancing automation. The adoption of IoT by industries has led to the next industrial revolution: Industry 4.0. The rise of the Industrial IoT (IIoT) promises to enhance factory management, process optimization, worker safety, and more. However, the rollout of the IIoT is not without significant issues, and many of these act as major barriers that prevent fully achieving the vision of Industry 4.0. One major area of concern is the security and privacy of the massive datasets that are captured and stored, which may leak information about intellectual property, trade secrets, and other competitive knowledge. As a way forward toward solving security and privacy concerns, we aim in this paper to identify common input-output (I/O) design patterns that exist in applications of the IIoT. These design patterns enable constructing an abstract model representation of data flow semantics used by such applications, and therefore better understand how to secure the information related to IIoT operations. In this paper, we describe communication protocols and identify common I/O design patterns for IIoT applications with an emphasis on data flow in edge devices, which, in the industrial control system (ICS) setting, are most often involved in process control or monitoring.},

	abstract = {In "BUNDLE: Real-Time Multi-Threaded Scheduling to Reduce Cache Contention" Tessler and Fisher present a positive perspective of instruction caches for hard real-time multithreaded tasks. The thread-aware scheduling algorithm limits the execution of threads to sets of instructions that cannot result in cache conflicts. Identification of these sets result in conflict free regions which are used to identify scheduling groups called bundles in the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm. Placement of a thread in a particular bundle depends on, what the authors call, "anticipating execution". However, they do not define a complete mechanism to anticipate execution. In this work, we propose a method to anticipate execution that modifies cache hardware and introduces a new interrupt raised prior to a cache conflict. This new interrupt is combined with (a slightly modified version of) the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm. The intent is to implement these hardware modifications for ARM on the gem5 simulator with the scheduling algorithm integrated into the RTEMS operating system. The hope is this work serves as further motivation to bring the positive perspective of caches to physical processors and operating systems.},

However, these existing methods may struggle to handle variable time intervals between messages during transitions of vehicle driving modes. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective method to ensure the security of the CAN bus that is based on constant message frequencies across vehicle driving modes. This proposed method does not require any modifications on the existing CAN bus and it is designed with the intent for efficient execution in platforms with very limited computational resources.

These devices communicate through the in-vehicle network for enhanced safety and comfort but are vulnerable to cyber-physical risks and attacks. A well-known technique of detecting these attacks and unusual events is by using intrusion detection systems. Anomalies in the network occur at unknown points and produce abrupt changes in the statistical features of the message stream. In this paper, we propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection approach using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) change-point detection algorithm to detect data injection attacks on the controller area network (CAN) bus. We leverage the parameters required for the change-point algorithm to reduce false alarm rate and detection delay. Using real dataset generated from a car in normal operation, we evaluate our detection approach on three different kinds of attack scenarios.},

	doi = {10.1109/RTAS.2019.00017},
	abstract = {Schedule randomization is one of the recently introduced security defenses against schedule-based attacks, i.e., attacks whose success depends on a particular ordering between the execution window of an attacker and a victim task within the system. It falls into the category of information hiding (as opposed to deterministic isolation-based defenses) and is designed to reduce the attacker's ability to infer the future schedule. This paper aims to investigate the limitations and vulnerabilities of schedule randomization-based defenses in real-time systems. We first provide definitions, categorization, and examples of schedule-based attacks, and then discuss the challenges of employing schedule randomization in real-time systems. Further, we provide a preliminary security test to determine whether a certain timing relation between the attacker and victim tasks will never happen in systems scheduled by a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm. Finally, we compare fixed-priority scheduling against schedule-randomization techniques in terms of the success rate of various schedule-based attacks for both synthetic and real-world applications. Our results show that, in many cases, schedule randomization either has no security benefits or can even increase the success rate of the attacker depending on the priority relation between the attacker and victim tasks.},

At the same time, timing and delivery reliability requirements in those scenarios are typically less demanding than those in other cases, thus enabling the adoption of best-effort notification approaches. This paper presents, evaluates, and compares some of those approaches, based on either standard Controller Area Network (CAN) messaging or a recently proposed protocol extension called CAN with eXtensible in-frame Reply (CAN XR). In the second case, the combined use of Bloom filters is also envisaged to increase flexibility. Results show that the latter approaches are advantageous in a range of event generation rates and network topologies of practical relevance.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of embedded devices in modern vehicles has opened the traditionally-closed vehicular system to the risk of cybersecurity attacks through physical and remote access to the in-vehicle network such as the controller area network (CAN). The CAN bus does not implement a security protocol that can protect the vehicle against the increasing cyber and physical attacks. To address this risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected from two passenger cars and on an open-source CAN dataset collected from real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data injection attacks with low false positive rates. Over four real attack scenarios from the open-source dataset, SAIDuCANT observes at most one false positive before detecting an attack whereas other detection approaches using CAN timing features detect on average more than a hundred false positives before a real attack occurs.},

In this paper, we describe our approach to design, implement, and certify a system with FACE Conformance to the FACE Operating System Segment Safety Base profile. Our approach integrates the ARINC 653-compliant Deos with RTEMS, an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS). Our goal in combining Deos/RTEMS was to achieve certification of FACE Conformance in a low-cost manner by relying on existing, mature software that already provides the majority of the functionality required by the FACE Technical Standard. We reached our goal with under 10,000 source lines of code (SLOC) written to integrate RTEMS into Deos and implement any additional POSIX application programming interfaces (APIs) and tests needed for certification.},

	abstract = {The smart city landscape is rife with opportunities for mobility and economic optimization, but also presents many security concerns spanning the range of components and systems in the smart ecosystem. One key enabler for this ecosystem is smart transportation and transit, which is foundationally built upon connected vehicles. Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing 100s of millions of lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly-integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrate effective security. We describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves throughout the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine the quality of the machine learning output.},
