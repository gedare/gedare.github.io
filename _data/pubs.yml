  title: Hardware-enforced fine-grained isolation of untrusted code
  container-title: Proceedings of the first ACM workshop on Secure execution of untrusted
    code
  publisher: ACM
  publisher-place: Chicago, Illinois, USA
  page: 11-18
  abstract: We present a novel combination of hardware (architecture) and software
    (compiler) techniques to support the safe execution of untrusted code. While other
    efforts focus on isolating processes, our approach isolates code and data at a
    function (as in, C function) level, to enable fine-grained protection within a
    process as needed for downloaded plugins, libraries, andmodifications of open-source
    projects. Our solution also enforces timing restrictions to detect denial of service
    from untrusted code, and supports protection of dynamically allocated memory.
    Because bookkeeping data can become substantial (permission tables that at their
    finest granularity describe which memory words may be accessed by which functions),
    our solution employs a stack-structured bookkeeping mechanism that tracks the
    flow of execution and automatically dispenses with bookkeeping data when no longer
    needed. This approach also enables an architectural optimization to handle permissions
    for dynamically allocated memory, allowing heap blocks to be appropriately shared
    across the trust boundary. Tested across a suite of benchmarks, our solution had
    a worst case 12% overhead and 3.5% average overhead at the finest level of code
    granularity (every single function in its own unit of isolation). The overhead
    is easily reduced by using trace-driven analysis to combine functions into coarser-grained
    groups that share permissions.

  title: Providing secure execution environments with a last line of defense against
    Trojan circuit attacks
  container-title: Computers & Security
  page: 660-669
  volume: '28'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: 'Integrated circuits (ICs) are often produced in foundries that lack effective
    security controls. In these foundries, sophisticated attackers are able to insert
    malicious Trojan circuits that are easily hidden in the large, complex circuitry
    that comprises modern ICs. These so-called Trojan circuits are capable of launching
    attacks directly in hardware, or, more deviously, can facilitate software attacks.
    Current defense against Trojan circuits consists of statistical detection techniques
    to find such circuits before product deployment. The fact that statistical detection
    can result in false negatives raises the obvious questions: can attacks be detected
    post-deployment, and is secure execution nonetheless possible using chips with
    undetected Trojan circuits? In this paper we present the Secure Heartbeat And
    Dual-Encryption (SHADE) architecture, a compiler–hardware solution for detecting
    and preventing a subset of Trojan circuit attacks in deployed systems. Two layers
    of hardware encryption are combined with a heartbeat of off-chip accesses to provide
    a secure execution environment using untrusted hardware. The SHADE system is designed
    to complement pre-deployment detection techniques and to add a final, last-chance
    layer of security. Keywords: Trojan circuit; Dual-encryption; HW/SW co-design;

  abstract: 'Much of modern software development consists of assembling together existing
    software components and writing the glue code that integrates them into a unified
    application. The term COTS-Based System (CBS) is often used to describe such applications,
    for which the components assembled are understood to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner
    of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time,
    pure-binary libraries incorporated at load-time, and plugins that are loaded into
    the application at execution time by the user.Because components have access to
    system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised
    by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support
    the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted
    platform for managing components and their interactions?We present an architecture
    that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware
    then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses
    or denial-of-service) and enables applications to undertake a hardware-supervised
    recovery procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record
    to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and
    further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose
    is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware.'

  publisher-place: Los Alamitos, CA, USA
  page: 100-103
  abstract: Rapid advances in integrated circuit (IC) development predicted by Moore’s
    Law lead to increasingly complex, hard to verify IC designs. Design insiders or
    adversaries employed at untrusted locations can insert malicious Trojan circuits
    capable of launching attacks in hardware or supporting software-based attacks.
    In this paper, we provide a method for detecting Trojan circuit denial-of-service
    attacks using a simple, verifiable hardware guard external to the complex CPU.
    The operating system produces liveness checks, embedded in the software clock,
    to which the guard can respond. We also present a novel method for the OS to detect
    a hardware-software (HW/SW) Trojan privilege escalation attack by using OS-generated
    checks to test if the CPU hardware is enforcing memory protection (MP). Our implementation
    of fine-grained periodic checking of MP enforcement incurs only 2.2% overhead
    using SPECint 2006.

  abstract: 'Hardware support can reduce the time spent operating on data structures
    by exploiting circuit-level parallelism. Such hardware data structures (HWDSs)
    can reduce the latency and jitter of data structure operations, which can benefit
    real-time systems by reducing worst-case execution times (WCETs). For example,
    a hardware priority queue (HWPQ) can enqueue and dequeue prioritized items in
    constant time with low variance; the best software implementations are in logarithmic-time
    asymptotic complexity for at least one of the enqueue or dequeue operations. The
    main problems with HWDSs are the limited size of hardware and the complexity of
    sharing it. In this paper we show that software support can help circumvent the
    size and sharing limitations of hardware so that applications can benefit from
    a HWDS. We evaluate our work by showing how the choice of software or hardware
    affects schedulability of task sets that use multiple priority queues of varying
    sizes. We model task behavior on two applications that are important in real-time
    and embedded domains: the grey-weighted distance transform for topology mapping
    and Dijkstra’s algorithm for GPS navigation. Our results indicate that HWDSs can
    reduce the WCET of applications even when a HWDS is shared by multiple data structures
    or when data structure sizes exceed HWDS size constraints.'

  abstract: Modern programs comprise multiple threads of execution inside a single

    We propose a hardware enforced, fine-grained memory protection mechanism to divide
    the process into smaller principals and multiple protection domains. Our approach
    supports modern software engineering better than traditional processes by enabling
    developers to align software components with protection mechanisms. We implemented
    our architecture using a cycle-accurate simulator of a complex out-of-order pipeline
    and evaluate our solution using open-source benchmarks and synthetic micro benchmarks
    designed specifically to stress our system.

  abstract: 'This chapter explores cyber-physical system security as it relates to
    computer hardware. Cyber-physical systems must ensure that physical compromises
    do not automatically lead to cyber compromises. Attacks on the processor supply
    chain represent a serious threat to cyber-physical systems – more so than servers
    and desktops – because critical control systems rely on hardware’s trustworthiness,
    without which catastrophe would result: trains, planes, and automobiles crashing,
    satellites failing, unmanned robots running amok – think of any real-time or embedded
    system and you will find a piece of hardware whose correctness and security is
    assumed implicitly. We discuss supply chain security for the design and fabrication
    of processor hardware in Section 12.2. Physical compromise of fielded devices
    offers an attacker with unique opportunities for studying, copying, and corrupting
    components of a cyber-physical system. If the hardware does not protect itself
    and its software, then little can be done against a sufficiently motivated and
    resourceful attack. In Section 12.3, we examine how hardware helps make software
    secure and consider in particular the challenging aspects of computer security
    for devices that are not physically secured.Keywords: Trojan circuit, design for

  abstract: Controlling software systems autonomously has been a challenging research
    area. Modern autonomous systems are guided by a plan, which is a sequence of actions
    to take to achieve a goal. Many planning algorithms exist today to produce plans
    given a problem definition and goal. To ease programmability of autonomous systems,
    many languages have been developed for defining problems and goals. However, planning
    algorithms tend to need to be customized not only for the problem definition language,
    but also for the problem definition itself. This work presents a new problem definition
    language called PyLOM, an interpreted, object-oriented language. The PyLOM run-time
    system uses generic algorithms, which do not need to be customized for each problem
    definition. Thus, PyLOM separates problem definitions from planning algorithms
    to ease programmability and software reuse. The choice of an object-oriented language
    also is intended to aid programmability, since prior problem definition languages
    adopt a functional programming style.

  title: Scheduling and Thread Management with RTEMS
  container-title: SIGBED Rev.
  page: 20-25
  volume: '11'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: The goal of a real-time operating system (RTOS) is to support real-time
    and embedded system (RT/ES) application development, which differ from general-purpose
    applications because of the size, weight, and power (SWaP) and timing constraints
    imposed by embedded applications. Useful RTOS features include real-time thread
    scheduling, thread communication, synchronization, interrupt handling, memory
    management, file systems, device drivers, networking, and debugging support. The
    Real-Time Executive for Multi-processor Systems (RTEMS) is a free and open-source
    RTOS that supports over a dozen processor architecture families and over 150 embedded
    system boards. RTEMS is designed to support embedded applications with stringent
    real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX.
    RTEMS includes optional services such as TCP/IP networking and file systems while
    still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations.
    One of the primary functions of an RTOS is to select threads that can obtain access
    to resources such as shared memory and processor time. RTEMS uses multiple algorithms
    to manage both waiting threads and those ready to execute. The thread execution
    schedulers include the traditional RTOS round robin and deterministic priority
    schedulers, rate monotonic, earliest deadline first (EDF), constant bandwidth
    server (CBS), and simple SMP scheduling algorithms. The RTEMS scheduling framework
    allows the application developer to select the thread scheduling algorithm that
    best meets the application’s space and time requirements. ÂăWe will present how
    this framework can be used by researchers to integrate their own scheduling algorithm
    into RTEMS and test it using a scheduling simulator before deploying it on target
    hardware.

  abstract: The protection of information in enterprise and cloud platforms is growing
    more important and complex with increasing numbers of users who need to access
    resources with distinct permissions. Role-based access control (RBAC) eases administrative
    complexity for large-scale access control, while a client-server model can ease
    performance bottlenecks by distributing access enforcement across multiple servers
    that consult the centralized access decision policy server as needed. In this
    paper, we propose a new approach to access enforcement using an existing associative
    array hardware data structure (HWDS) to cache authorizations in a distributed
    system using RBAC. This HWDS approach uses hardware that has previous been demonstrated
    as useful for several application domains including access control, network packet
    routing, and generic comparison-based integer search algorithms. We reproduce
    experiments from prior work on distributed access enforcement for RBAC systems,
    and we design and conduct new experiments to evaluate HWDS-based access enforcement.
    Experimental data show the HWDS cuts session initiation time by about a third
    compared to existing solutions, while achieving similar performance to authorize
    access requests. These results suggest that distributed systems using RBAC could
    use HWDS-based access enforcement to increase session throughput or to decrease
    the number of access enforcement servers without losing performance.

    benefit from the rich theory of schedulability analysis, and yet translating these
    algorithms to practical implementations can be challenging. This paper presents
    a Java model of the priority inheritance protocol for mutual exclusion, as implemented
    in the RTEMS open-source real-time operating system. We verified this model using
    Java Pathfinder to detect potential data races, deadlocks, and priority inversions.
    JPF detected a known bug in the RTEMS implementation, which we modified along
    with the Java model. Verification of the modified model showed the absence of
    data races, deadlocks, and established nine protocol-specific correctness properties.

    Systems and Networks (DSN)
  page: 227-238
  abstract: As the processor feature sizes shrink, mitigating faults in low level
    system services has become a critical aspect of dependable system design. In this
    paper we introduce SuperGlue, an interface description language (IDL) and compiler
    for recovery from transient faults in a component-based operating system. SuperGlue
    generates code for interface-driven recovery that uses commodity hardware isolation,
    micro-rebooting, and interface-directed fault recovery to provide predictable
    and efficient recovery from faults that impact low-level system services. SuperGlue
    decreases the amount of recovery code system designers need to implement by an
    order of magnitude, and replaces it with declarative specifications. We evaluate
    SuperGlue with a fault injection campaign in low-level system components (e.g.,
    memory mapping manager and scheduler). Additionally, we evaluate the performance
    of SuperGlue in a web-server application. Results show that SuperGlue improves
    system reliability with only a small performance degradation of 11.84%.

    and Trust (HOST)
  page: 48-51
  abstract: Hardware Trojans compromise security by invalidating the assumption that
    hardware provides a root-of-trust for secure systems. We propose a novel approach
    for an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC) to ensure confidentiality of trusted software
    despite hardware Trojan attacks. Our approach employs defensive techniques that
    feature morphing on-chip resources for moving target defense against fabrication-time
    Trojans, onion-encryption for confidentiality, and replication of functionally-equivalent
    variants of processing elements with arbitrated voting for resilience to design-time
    Trojans. These techniques are enabled by partial runtime reconfiguration (PRR)
    and are managed by a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that reduces developer burden.
    We call our approach the Morph Onion-encryption Replication PRR HAL, or MORPH.
    MORPH aims to provide a stable interface for embedded systems developers to use
    in deploying applications that are resilient to hardware Trojans.

  page: 7:1-7:6
  abstract: This paper introduces quarantine, a new security primitive for an operating
    system to use in order to protect information and isolate malicious behavior.
    Quarantine’s core feature is the ability to fork a protection domain on-the-fly
    to isolate a specific principal’s execution of untrusted code without risk of
    a compromise spreading. Forking enables the OS to ensure service continuity by
    permitting even high-risk operations to proceed, albeit subject to greater scrutiny
    and constraints. Quarantine even partitions executing threads that share resources
    into isolated protection domains. We discuss the design and implementation of
    quarantine within the LockDown OS, a security-focused evolution of the Composite
    component-based microkernel OS. Initial performance results for quarantine show
    that about 98% of the overhead comes from the cost of copying memory to the new
    protection domain.

  abstract: Modern systems are composed of many different protection domains separating
    privilege levels, subsystems, users, clients, and software of differing levels
    of assurance. System-wide memory management must consider not only allocation
    to single processes, but also efficient sharing of data across protection domains,
    and the allocation of memory based on the performance of applications that span
    multiple protection domains. This paper introduces the CBuf system for the global
    management of virtual and physical memory, including zero-copy sharing between
    protection domains. We present the design and implementation of both garbage collection
    techniques to enable efficient sharing, and policies that balance memory between
    protection domains specifically to satisfy system and application constraints
    such as quality of service. We show that a CBuf-enabled webserver achieves over
    a factor of 2.5 throughput speedup while using less processing time than Apache
    on Linux, and that the system can intentionally control system throughput through
    intelligent memory allocation.

  container-title: 2017 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Factory Communication

  page: 1-10
  abstract: Thanks to its distributed and asynchronous medium access control mechanism,
    CAN is the ideal choice for interconnecting devices in event-driven systems. When
    timing requirements of applications are not particularly demanding, as in the
    case of, e.g., reactive and proactive maintenance, constraints on event delivery
    can be relaxed, so that their notification may rely on best-effort approaches.
    In this paper, a number of techniques are taken into account for notifying events
    in such a kind of systems, and their performance has been evaluated. Besides conventional
    CAN, a recent proposal for extending this protocol, termed CAN XR, is considered.
    Moreover, the adoption of Bloom filters to cope with rare events in very large
    systems has also been evaluated.

  abstract: The ever-increasing variety of services built on top of the Controller
    Area Network (CAN), along with the recent discovery of vulnerabilities in CAN-based
    automotive systems (some of them demonstrated in practice), stimulated a renewed
    attention to security-oriented enhancements of the CAN protocol. The issue is
    further compounded nowadays because, unlike in the past, security can no longer
    be enforced by physical bus segregation. This paper describes how CAN XR, a recently
    proposed extension of the CAN data-link layer, can effectively support the distributed
    calculation of arbitrary binary Boolean functions, which are the foundation of
    most security protocols, without necessarily disclosing their operands on the
    bus. The feasibility of the approach is then shown through experimental evaluation
    and by confirming its applicability to a shared key generation protocol proposed
    in literature.

  abstract: The landscape of automotive in-vehicle networks is changing driven by
    the vast options for infotainment features and progress toward fully-autonomous
    vehicles. However, the security of automotive networks is lagging behind feature-driven

  abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) offers immense benefits by enabling devices
    to leverage networked resources thereby making intelligent decisions. The numerous
    heterogeneous connected devices that exist throughout the IoT system creates new
    security and privacy concerns. Some of these concerns can be overcome through
    trust, transparency, and integrity, which can be achieved with data provenance.
    Data provenance, also known as data lineage, provides a history of transformations
    that occurs on a data object from the time it was created to its current state.
    Data provenance has been explored in the areas of scientific computing, business,
    forensic analysis, and intrusion detection. Data provenance can help in detecting
    and mitigating malicious cyber attacks. In this paper, we explore the integration
    of provenance within the IoT. We introduce Provenance Aware Internet of Things
    System (PAIoTS), a provenance collection framework for IoT devices. We evaluate
    the effectiveness of our framework by developing a prototype system for proof
    of concept.

  abstract: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast collection of interconnected sensors,
    devices, and services that share data and information over the Internet with the
    objective of leveraging multiple information sources to optimize related systems.
    The technologies associated with the IoT have significantly improved the quality
    of many existing applications by reducing costs, improving functionality, increasing
    access to resources, and enhancing automation. The adoption of IoT by industries
    has led to the next industrial revolution: Industry 4.0. The rise of the Industrial
    IoT (IIoT) promises to enhance factory management, process optimization, worker
    safety, and more. However, the rollout of the IIoT is not without significant
    issues, and many of these act as major barriers that prevent fully achieving the
    vision of Industry 4.0. One major area of concern is the security and privacy
    of the massive datasets that are captured and stored, which may leak information
    about intellectual property, trade secrets, and other competitive knowledge. As
    a way forward toward solving security and privacy concerns, we aim in this paper
    to identify common input-output (I/O) design patterns that exist in applications
    of the IIoT. These design patterns enable constructing an abstract model representation
    of data flow semantics used by such applications, and therefore better understand
    how to secure the information related to IIoT operations. In this paper, we describe
    communication protocols and identify common I/O design patterns for IIoT applications
    with an emphasis on data flow in edge devices, which, in the industrial control
    system (ICS) setting, are most often involved in process control or monitoring.'

  abstract: 'In "BUNDLE: Real-Time Multi-Threaded Scheduling to Reduce Cache Contention"
    Tessler and Fisher present a positive perspective of instruction caches for hard
    real-time multithreaded tasks. The thread-aware scheduling algorithm limits the
    execution of threads to sets of instructions that cannot result in cache conflicts.
    Identification of these sets result in conflict free regions which are used to
    identify scheduling groups called bundles in the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm.
    Placement of a thread in a particular bundle depends on, what the authors call,
    "anticipating execution". However, they do not define a complete mechanism to
    anticipate execution. In this work, we propose a method to anticipate execution
    that modifies cache hardware and introduces a new interrupt raised prior to a
    cache conflict. This new interrupt is combined with (a slightly modified version
    of) the BUNDLE scheduling algorithm. The intent is to implement these hardware
    modifications for ARM on the gem5 simulator with the scheduling algorithm integrated
    into the RTEMS operating system. The hope is this work serves as further motivation
    to bring the positive perspective of caches to physical processors and operating
    systems.'

  abstract: The modern automobile relies on numerous electronic control units communicating
    over the de facto standard of the controller area network (CAN) bus. This communication
    network was not developed with cybersecurity in mind. Many methods based on constant
    time intervals between messages have been proposed to address this lack of security
    issue with the CAN bus. However, these existing methods may struggle to handle
    variable time intervals between messages during transitions of vehicle driving
    modes. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective method to ensure the security
    of the CAN bus that is based on constant message frequencies across vehicle driving
    modes. This proposed method does not require any modifications on the existing
    CAN bus and it is designed with the intent for efficient execution in platforms
    with very limited computational resources. Test results with the proposed method
    against two different vehicles and a frequency domain analysis are also presented
    in the paper.

  abstract: The modern vehicle has transformed from a purely mechanical system to
    a system that embeds several electronic devices. These devices communicate through
    the in-vehicle network for enhanced safety and comfort but are vulnerable to cyber-physical
    risks and attacks. A well-known technique of detecting these attacks and unusual
    events is by using intrusion detection systems. Anomalies in the network occur
    at unknown points and produce abrupt changes in the statistical features of the
    message stream. In this paper, we propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection
    approach using the cumulative sum (CUSUM) change-point detection algorithm to
    detect data injection attacks on the controller area network (CAN) bus. We leverage
    the parameters required for the change-point algorithm to reduce false alarm rate
    and detection delay. Using real dataset generated from a car in normal operation,
    we evaluate our detection approach on three different kinds of attack scenarios.

  abstract: Security of vehicular networks has often been an afterthought since they
    are designed traditionally to be a closed system. An attack could lead to catastrophic
    effect which may include loss of human life or severe injury to the driver and
    passengers of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to extract
    the real-time model of the controller area network (CAN) and develop a specification-based
    intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with
    the real-time model as input. We evaluate IDS performance with real CAN logs collected
    from a sedan car.

  title: On the Pitfalls and Vulnerabilities of Schedule Randomization Against Schedule-Based
    Attacks
  container-title: 2019 IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium
    (RTAS)
  page: 103-116
  note: 'ISSN: 1545-3421'
  abstract: Schedule randomization is one of the recently introduced security defenses
    against schedule-based attacks, i.e., attacks whose success depends on a particular
    ordering between the execution window of an attacker and a victim task within
    the system. It falls into the category of information hiding (as opposed to deterministic
    isolation-based defenses) and is designed to reduce the attacker’s ability to
    infer the future schedule. This paper aims to investigate the limitations and
    vulnerabilities of schedule randomization-based defenses in real-time systems.
    We first provide definitions, categorization, and examples of schedule-based attacks,
    and then discuss the challenges of employing schedule randomization in real-time
    systems. Further, we provide a preliminary security test to determine whether
    a certain timing relation between the attacker and victim tasks will never happen
    in systems scheduled by a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm. Finally, we compare
    fixed-priority scheduling against schedule-randomization techniques in terms of
    the success rate of various schedule-based attacks for both synthetic and real-world
    applications. Our results show that, in many cases, schedule randomization either
    has no security benefits or can even increase the success rate of the attacker
    depending on the priority relation between the attacker and victim tasks.

  container-title: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics

  issue: '10'
  abstract: Preventive and reactive maintenance require the collection of an ever-increasing
    amount of information from industrial plants and other complex systems such as
    those based on robotized cells, a need that can be fulfilled by means of a suitable
    event notification mechanism. At the same time, timing and delivery reliability
    requirements in those scenarios are typically less demanding than those in other
    cases, thus enabling the adoption of best-effort notification approaches. This
    paper presents, evaluates, and compares some of those approaches, based on either
    standard Controller Area Network (CAN) messaging or a recently proposed protocol
    extension called CAN with eXtensible in-frame Reply (CAN XR). In the second case,
    the combined use of Bloom filters is also envisaged to increase flexibility. Results
    show that the latter approaches are advantageous in a range of event generation
    rates and network topologies of practical relevance.

  note: 'Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology'
  abstract: The proliferation of embedded devices in modern vehicles has opened the
    traditionally-closed vehicular system to the risk of cybersecurity attacks through
    physical and remote access to the in-vehicle network such as the controller area
    network (CAN). The CAN bus does not implement a security protocol that can protect
    the vehicle against the increasing cyber and physical attacks. To address this
    risk, we introduce a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model parameters
    of the CAN bus and develop SAIDuCANT, a specification-based intrusion detection
    system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model
    as input. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAIDuCANT with real CAN logs collected
    from two passenger cars and on an open-source CAN dataset collected from real-world
    scenarios. Experimental results show that SAIDuCANT can effectively detect data
    injection attacks with low false positive rates. Over four real attack scenarios
    from the open-source dataset, SAIDuCANT observes at most one false positive before
    detecting an attack whereas other detection approaches using CAN timing features
    detect on average more than a hundred false positives before a real attack occurs.

  abstract: The avionics industry is converging toward the next generation of software
    standards produced by The Open Group via the Future Airborne Capability Environment
    (FACE) consortium and related FACE Technical Standard. The standard combines ARINC
    653, a previous avionics standard, with subsets of POSIX 1003.1 that are closely
    aligned with the POSIX realtime profiles PSE52, PSE53, and PSE54. In this paper,
    we describe our approach to design, implement, and certify a system with FACE
    Conformance to the FACE Operating System Segment Safety Base profile. Our approach
    integrates the ARINC 653-compliant Deos with RTEMS, an open-source real-time operating
    system (RTOS). Our goal in combining Deos/RTEMS was to achieve certification of
    FACE Conformance in a low-cost manner by relying on existing, mature software
    that already provides the majority of the functionality required by the FACE Technical
    Standard. We reached our goal with under 10,000 source lines of code (SLOC) written
    to integrate RTEMS into Deos and implement any additional POSIX application programming
    interfaces (APIs) and tests needed for certification.

  note: 'Conference Name: IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine'
  abstract: The smart city landscape is rife with opportunities for mobility and economic
    optimization, but also presents many security concerns spanning the range of components
    and systems in the smart ecosystem. One key enabler for this ecosystem is smart
    transportation and transit, which is foundationally built upon connected vehicles.
    Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian
    safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive
    systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing
    devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing 100s of millions of
    lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly-integrated cyber-physical
    system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrate effective security. We
    describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging
    unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs
    that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves throughout
    the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart
    city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine
    the quality of the machine learning output.

  title: Precise Cache Profiling for Studying Radiation Effects
  container-title: ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems
  page: 25:1-25:25
  volume: '20'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Increased access to space has led to an increase in the usage of commodity
    processors in radiation environments. These processors are vulnerable to transient
    faults such as single event upsets that may cause bit-flips in processor components.
    Caches in particular are vulnerable due to their relatively large area, yet are
    often omitted from fault injection testing because many processors do not provide
    direct access to cache contents and they are often not fully modeled by simulators.
    The performance benefits of caches make disabling them undesirable, and the presence
    of error correcting codes is insufficient to correct for increasingly common multiple
    bit upsets. This work explores building a program’s cache profile by collecting
    cache usage information at an instruction granularity via commonly available on-chip
    debugging interfaces. The profile provides a tighter bound than cache utilization
    for cache vulnerability estimates (50% for several benchmarks). This can be applied
    to reduce the number of fault injections required to characterize behavior by
    at least two-thirds for the benchmarks we examine. The profile enables future
    work in hardware fault injection for caches that avoids the biases of existing
    techniques.

  title: Detecting and Classifying Self-Deleting Windows Malware Using Prefetch Files
  container-title: 2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and
    Conference (CCWC)
  page: 0745-0751
  abstract: Malware detection and analysis can be a burdensome task for incident responders.
    As such, research has turned to machine learning to automate malware detection
    and malware family classification. Existing work extracts and engineers static
    and dynamic features from the malware sample to train classifiers. Despite promising
    results, such techniques assume that the analyst has access to the malware executable
    file. Self-deleting malware invalidates this assumption and requires analysts
    to find forensic evidence of malware execution for further analysis. In this paper,
    we present and evaluate an approach to detecting malware that executed on a Windows
    target and further classify the malware into its associated family to provide
    semantic insight. Specifically, we engineer features from the Windows prefetch
    file, a file system forensic artifact that archives process information. Results
    show that it is possible to detect the malicious artifact with 99% accuracy; furthermore,
    classifying the malware into a fine-grained family has comparable performance
    to techniques that require access to the original executable. We also provide
    a thorough security discussion of the proposed approach against adversarial diversity.

    is known that a self-interested mining pool can dishonestly siphon off another
    pool’s mining rewards by executing a block withholding (BWH) attack. In this paper,
    we show that a BWH attack is always unprofitable for an initial startup period
    which is at least one difficulty retarget interval (approximately 14 days for
    Bitcoin). Furthermore, we prove that the payback period to recoup this initial
    startup cost is always at least as long as the initial unprofitable startup interval,
    and we show numerically that it can be substantially longer. Thus, the decision
    of whether or not to execute a BWH attack is not a dominant strategy, and the
    so called Miner’s Dilemma is not in fact a dilemma.

  note: 'ISSN: 2331-9860'
  abstract: Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) today must quickly provide
    visibility into anomalous behavior on a growing amount of data. Meanwhile different
    data models have evolved over time, each providing a different set of features
    to classify attacks. Defenders have limited time to retrain classifiers, while
    the scale of data and feature mismatch between data models can affect the ability
    to periodically retrain. Much work has focused on classification accuracy yet
    feature selection is a key part of machine learning that, when optimized, reduces
    the training time and can increase accuracy by removing poorly performing features
    that introduce noise. With a larger feature space, the pursuit of more features
    is not as valuable as selecting better features. In this paper, we use an ensemble
    approach of filter methods to rank features followed by a voting technique to
    select a subset of features. We evaluate our approach using three datasets to
    show that, across datasets and network topologies, similar features have a trivial
    effect on classifier accuracy after removal. Our approach identifies poorly performing
    features to remove in a classifier-agnostic manner that can significantly save
    time for periodic retraining of production NIDS.

  title: Vulnerability of Controller Area Network to Schedule-Based Attacks
  container-title: 2021 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS)
  page: 495-507
  note: 'ISSN: 2576-3172'
  abstract: The secure functioning of automotive systems is vital to the safety of
    their passengers and other roadway users. One of the critical functions for safety
    is the controller area network (CAN), which interconnects the safety-critical
    electronic control units (ECUs) in the majority of ground vehicles. Unfortunately
    CAN is known to be vulnerable to several attacks. One such attack is the bus-off
    attack, which can be used to cause a victim ECU to disconnect itself from the
    CAN bus and, subsequently, for an attacker to masquerade as that ECU. A limitation
    of the bus-off attack is that it requires the attacker to achieve tight synchronization
    between the transmission of the victim and the attacker’s injected message. In
    this paper, we introduce a schedule-based attack framework for the CAN bus-off
    attack that uses the real-time schedule of the CAN bus to predict more attack
    opportunities than previously known. We describe a ranking method for an attacker
    to select and optimize its attack injections with respect to criteria such as
    attack success rate, bus perturbation, or attack latency. The results show that
    vulnerabilities of the CAN bus can be enhanced by schedulebased attacks.

  note: 'ISSN: 2576-3172'
  abstract: Several cyber-physical systems use real-time restart-based embedded systems
    with the Simplex architecture to provide safety guarantees against system faults.
    Some approaches have been developed to protect such systems from security violations
    too, but none of these approaches can prevent an adversary from modifying the
    operating system or application code to execute an attack that persists even after
    a reboot. In this work, we present a secure boot mechanism to restore real-time
    restart-based embedded systems into a secure computing environment after every
    restart. We analyze the delay introduced by the proposed security feature and
    present preliminary results to demonstrate the viability of our approach using
    an open-source bootloader and real-time operating system.

  title: Modular Network Stacks in the Real- Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems
  container-title: 2021 Resilience Week (RWS)
  page: 1-7
  abstract: Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS) is a real-time
    operating system used by the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System
    (EPICS) open-source software for high-precision scientific instruments such as
    particle accelerators and telescopes. EPICS relies on the networking capabilities
    of RTEMS for microcontrollers that need to meet real-time constraints. However,
    the networking available in RTEMS either lacks the necessary drivers to be fully
    operational or lacks security features required in modern networks. In this paper,
    we introduce a modular networking architecture for RTEMS by separating the network
    software implementation and device drivers from the RTEMS kernel to provide them
    as a static library for applications to use. This networking-as-a-library concept
    provides application developers with better capabilities to select the network
    features needed for their target application and to keep their networking software
    undated and secure.

  title-short: The gem5 Simulator
  container-title: arXiv:2007.03152 \[cs\]
  note: 'arXiv: 2007.03152'
  abstract: The open-source and community-supported gem5 simulator is one of the most
    popular tools for computer architecture research. This simulation infrastructure
    allows researchers to model modern computer hardware at the cycle level, and it
    has enough fidelity to boot unmodified Linux-based operating systems and run full
    applications for multiple architectures including x86, Arm, and RISC-V. The gem5
    simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the
    original gem5 release. In this time, there have been over 7500 commits to the
    codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by
    adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality. In this paper,
    we give and overview of gem5’s usage and features, describe the current state
    of the gem5 simulator, and enumerate the major changes since the initial release
    of gem5. We also discuss how the gem5 simulator has transitioned to a formal governance
    model to enable continued improvement and community support for the next 20 years
    of computer architecture research.

  abstract: Arbitrary processor affinities are used in multiprocessor systems to specify
    the processors on which a task can be scheduled. However, affinity constraints
    can prevent some high priority real-time tasks from being scheduled, while lower
    priority tasks execute. This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of
    the Strong Arbitrary Processor Affinity scheduling on a real-time operating system,
    an approach that not only respects user-defined affinities, but also supports
    migration of a higher priority task to allow execution of a task limited by affinity
    constraints. Results show an improvement in response and turnaround times of higher
    priority tasks.

  title: Competitive Information Provision Among Internet Routing Nodes
  container-title: 2023 American Control Conference (ACC)
  page: 1074-1079
  note: 'ISSN: 2378-5861'
  abstract: In proposed path-aware designs for the Internet, end hosts can select
    which path their packets use. What criteria should the end hosts use to select
    paths? Recent work has proposed path-aware access control frameworks in which
    routing nodes publicly report their knowledge of the security postures of other
    nodes; end hosts can then base their routing choices on these reports. However,
    nothing is known regarding the nodes’ incentives to report their knowledge truthfully.
    In this paper, we consider the case in which each network node is strategic, and
    seeks to craft its public reports to manipulate traffic patterns in its own favor.
    In the context of a simple selfish routing problem with two strategic nodes, we
    show that for a wide swath of the parameter space, each node has a dominant reporting
    strategy, meaning that its individually optimal strategy does not depend on the
    strategy of the other node. These dominant strategies are generally not truthful.
    At the resulting dominant-strategy Nash equilibrium, we show that the expected
    social cost is (often considerably) higher than that achieved when both nodes
    are completely truthful. Nonetheless, we prove that these equilibrium reporting
    strategies are never perverse, meaning that their resulting social cost is never
    worse than if traffic were uninformed as to network state.

  abstract: Microservice architectures decompose web applications into loosely-coupled,
    distributed components that interact with each other to provide an overall service.
    While this popular software architecture paradigm has many advantages in development
    and deployment, it also introduces a wider attack surface that is vulnerable to
    both internal and external attackers. Potentially malicious third-party services
    or software packages, as well as increased communication endpoints, introduce
    a wide array of security concerns. To improve the resiliency of microservice-based
    applications, many of which store sensitive data, we propose a novel, path-based
    anomaly detection and access control infrastructure that requires no modifications
    to existing software. We propose leveraging trusted proxies deployed alongside
    each service for request inspection, anomaly detection and signed token propagation
    for end-user path validation. Our approach reduces the trusted computing base
    away from the microservices to a smaller set of components that allow for less
    trust and a smaller attack surface.

    Therefore, this article proposes L-IDS, a lightweight hardware-assisted intrusion
    detection system that combines hardware-assisted security, such as Trusted Execution
    Environment, with machine learning algorithms to detect and mitigate ransomware
    inside an IoT system with fewer resources. The proposed approach can more effectively
    protect IoT systems from ransomware attacks and requires less resources than traditional
    security scanning methods.

  abstract: Ensuring the data integrity of messages transmitted over the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus and other vehicular networks is achieved through the implementation
    of cryptographic authentication protocols. However, these protocols raise concerns
    about a significant increase in response time due to the restrictions on CAN frame
    size and bandwidth. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact
    on response time of CAN and CAN Flexible Data-rate (CAN FD) messages with the
    implementation of cryptographic message authentication codes (MACs) and the periodic
    transmission of these codes. Our evaluation is based on a randomized schedulability
    experiment to provide insights into the overhead incurred by adding authentication
    to the frame payloads.

  note: 'Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology'
  abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) dominates in-vehicle networking systems
    in modern vehicles. CAN was designed with low-latency and reliability as key features.
    Authenticity of a CAN frame was not considered in the design, thus, most in-vehicle
    network nodes inherently trust received messages as coming from a legitimate source.
    As a result, it is trivial to program (or hack) a network node to spoof traffic.
    Authentication is challenging for CAN and related protocols, such as SAE J1939,
    due to limited frame sizes and high bus utilization. Adding a message authentication
    code (MAC) as a separate message can unduly stress the real-time delivery of safety-critical
    messages. Although this stressor is well-known, the impact of authentication protocols
    on real-time message delivery in CAN has not yet been thoroughly examined. In
    this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of real-time schedulability
    analysis applied to authentication schemes for CAN, CAN Flexible Data-rate (CAN
    FD), and CAN extra long payload (CAN XL). We formulate the response time analysis
    for addition of MACs and periodic transmission of MACs, and we examine their impact
    on two case studies and through evaluation with randomized schedulability experiments
    over a wide range of message sets.

  title: Secure Reboots for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems
  container-title: Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on CPS & IoT Security and Privacy

  publisher: Association for Computing Machinery
  publisher-place: New York, NY, USA

  abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as industrial control systems, automobiles,
    and medical devices often consist of applications with real-time properties. Due
    to the safety-critical nature of the application domain, multiple security and
    fault tolerance approaches have been studied and used in safety-critical CPS.
    One of the popular approaches for CPS safety is the Simplex architecture, which
    has also been used recently to strengthen the security of the CPS. The simplex
    architecture supports the integration of safe controllers for dependable systems,
    and when combined with periodic restarts, the architecture can reset the CPS into
    a safe state after each restart. However, these restart-based systems do not protect
    the system against attacks that persist beyond a restart. Such attacks can be
    mitigated using secure boot, which is a widely used approach for securing general
    computing systems but is not used in real-time systems due to the overhead of
    the boot process. This paper presents an analytical framework and derives feasibility
    conditions to enable secure reboots in real-time applications. The schedulability
    conditions presented can be used to design and integrate secure reboot into Simplex-based
    CPS. Our analysis shows that secure boot adds a deterministic and low-performance
    overhead, which can be as low as 0.08%.

  abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an active area for innovation and an
    essential tool in achieving smart cities through the integration of vehicles with
    the Internet of Things (IoT). IoV is a distributed network that aids in handling
    the data generated by vehicular sensors and vehicle-to-everything communication
    (V2X), thus enabling novel applications such as autonomous driving and platooning
    while increasing safety and energy efficiency. In IoV, the sensors and the interdependent
    devices relay critical information for the efficient implementation of real-time
    applications in the ecosystem. Despite all these advancements, a vital challenge
    is establishing smooth communication among interconnected devices, concretely,
    interoperability in the IoV—a deceptively simple notion that is not yet fully
    addressed to achieve a fully integrated ecosystem. This is mainly because the
    networked domains, such as home, grid, and health care, are developed in silos,
    operating independently with diverse processes and protocols. Hence, seamless
    exchange of information is yet to be achieved across the ecosystem, hindering
    the maximization of the full promise of IoV. In this paper, we provide an in-depth
    analysis of the present state of interoperability and comprehensively survey the
    challenges in IoV. We present a taxonomy of interoperability approaches, review
    solutions that prior work have proposed, and provide insights on how to address
    the current challenges. Finally, we identify open problems that persist and future
    directions for research.

  title: 'CUPID: A labeled dataset with Pentesting for evaluation of network intrusion
    detection'
  title-short: CUPID
  container-title: Journal of Systems Architecture
  page: '102621'
  volume: '129'
  abstract: Reproducibility of network intrusion detection research necessitates widely
    available datasets that represent real-world scenarios. One of the key omissions
    of existing datasets used in empirical evaluations of network intrusions is the
    lack of human-generated traffic with accurate labels to distinguish benign and
    malicious behavior. Using an emulated network environment with a vulnerable web
    application, we collected baseline traffic, human-generated normal user traffic,
    automated attacks, and the attacks of ten human penetration testers of varying
    abilities. We preprocessed this collected data to produce a new dataset named
    the Colorado University Pentesting Intrusion Dataset (CUPID). The attacks span
    from reconnaissance activities to delivery of an exploit payload. To our knowledge,
    this is the first collection that provides labeled, Institutional Review Board-approved,
    benign and attacker data that is publicly available. The CUPID dataset can be
    used to train and test the limits of classification-based machine learning algorithms
    used for network intrusion detection systems.

  title: Evaluating Feature Robustness for Windows Malware Family Classification
  container-title: 2022 International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks
    (ICCCN)
  page: 1-10
  note: 'ISSN: 2637-9430'
  abstract: Machine learning approaches to classify malware by family save analysts
    valuable time during incident response. A key challenge for these approaches is
    selecting features that are robust against concept drift, which describes the
    change in malware over time. In this paper, we evaluate a dynamic feature set
    based on Windows handles (e.g., files, registry keys) for malware family classification.
    Specifically, we examine the features’ vulnerabilities and evaluate their robustness
    against concept drift. We curated a novel dataset that simulates the manipulations
    that attackers may invoke on malware samples. We demonstrate improved robustness
    to concept drift over traditional API call-based features by training machine
    learning classifiers on malware collected in the wild, and testing the classifiers
    against samples that underwent manipulations. Further, we investigate time decay
    due to concept drift using temporally consistent evaluations that do not assume
    access to newer information. The evaluation shows that our features are robust
    against malware obfuscation. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate how malware
    labeling conventions (malware type or family) can affect results, and make recommendations
    for dataset construction.

  abstract: In this poster, we introduce path-aware risk scores for access control
    (PARSAC), a novel context-sensitive technique to enrich access requests with risk
    scoring of the path taken by those requests between the authenticated user and
    the resources they access. These path-aware risk scores enable another layer of
    security for traditional access control systems that addresses the need for fine-grained
    monitoring and enforcement within a zero-trust architecture. We define rules for
    general functions that can be used to determine risk and instantiate a specific
    approach to calculate path risk scores. We evaluate our approach with realistic
    network graphs; PARSAC finds more paths with lower risk when compared with traditional
    routing algorithms that select the shortest path.
