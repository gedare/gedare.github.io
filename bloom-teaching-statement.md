I developed my pedagogy from experiences guiding students through coding
modules, delivering lectures, attending teaching seminars, reading about
learning, and mentoring students. <span>**My teaching style uses
participatory lectures with guided discovery and constructionist
problem-solving assignments.**</span> My objective is to prepare
students to succeed post-graduation, and four primary goals guide my
approach:

1.  <span>**Cultivate student motivation.**</span> Intrinsic motivation
    can create life-long learners who test better, stay in school, and
    are successful after graduation @deci_motivation_1991. Some methods
    I use to encourage motivation are to dispel
    misconceptions @demetriou_potential_2005 and to give meaning to
    efforts @yeager_boring_2014. In addition to common misconceptions,
    computing majors face additional misconceptions, such as: only men
    can do it, only geniuses can do it, the math is too hard, if I do it
    well then I’ll be a social outcast (nerd, geek), programming is
    tedious non-creative work. For example, Mackenzie Morgan, an
    International Affairs major taking my computer organization lab, was
    considering switching majors to CS, but she was terrified of math. I
    explained how math in CS differs from high school math, and that I
    felt she would do well at it. <span>**Next semester she told me that
    I convinced her to become a CS major, but what I really did was
    dispel her misconceptions and ease her fears.**</span> Mackenzie
    graduated with a BS in CS and now works in industry.

    Naïve approaches to give meaning to students, such as telling them
    how important learning is for their future, can be
    counter-productive. One approach that works is to have students
    explain how a course may be relevant to their
    lives @hulleman_enhancing_2010. Another approach that has worked
    well for me is to describe anecdotes of former students, such as
    Irie Grant, who came to my office one day to tell me that he was
    able to “knock out the interviews and land the position at
    Salesforce” because they asked him to explain how threads and
    synchronization work—I like to tell this story on the second day of
    an OS class, just before we introduce the process and
    threading model.

2.  <span>**Improve teamwork with active learning.**</span> To improve
    teamwork skills needed in the working world, my classes include team
    projects, <span>**which also increase student interest, thus
    motivation @ludi_introductory_2005.**</span> The team projects I
    design give students breadth starting from a problem and designing,
    implementing, testing, documenting, and presenting a solution.
    Students learn about teamwork, team roles, conflict resolution, and
    version control @lutz_undergraduate_2014. When possible, I prefer to
    form student teams by mixing students with different backgrounds and
    strengths, which the SCALE-UP @beichner_student-centered_2007
    project has shown provides measurable benefits in both small and
    large classes to student understanding, attitude, problem solving,
    and success, especially for underrepresented groups. Non-CS students
    have told me that working with CS majors provided new insights into
    software design. I try to mix better- and worse-performing students,
    preferring to mix majors in cross-listed courses. One non-CS student
    wrote these teams “worked wonders at keeping anyone from falling
    behind on the assignments.” Mixing students in teams works well,
    though some care must be taken for grading and conflict resolution.
    Open-source projects are another great way for students to get
    excited about software and team-based development. I have
    experimented with teaching open-source concepts that apply my domain
    knowledge with RTEMS to benefit students. I have guided students in
    learning research methods and software engineering processes
    including version control, code review—which provides many
    educational benefits @guo_refining_2014–and collaborative software
    (<span>*e.g.*</span>, instant messaging, wikis, Google Docs,
    GitHub). Students have responded positively to my use of
    collaborative tools in class, for example one student wrote she
    liked that I make myself available “throughout the final hours
    before a lab assignment is due, allowing students the chance to work
    through last-minute problems that might otherwise have
    defeated them.”

3.  <span>**Foster technical writing skills.**</span> I believe strongly
    in a “writing in the disciplines (WID)” approach for improving
    students’ communication skills @kay_computer_1998. In all of my
    courses, I try to include the following WID coursework components: a
    research-oriented team homework assignment with an oral and written
    report; a summary and evaluation of a talk by a guest lecturer; and
    a term project with a design document, oral presentation, and
    written report. I also encourage student blogs—similar to
    development process journals @drexel_writing_1998—for writing about
    project design and implementation challenges. <span>**I have found
    student-developer blogs are useful to me for gauging understanding
    and progress, and useful to students for self-reflection
    and report-writing.**</span> I plan to create and improve WID
    assignments to teach students how to communicate technical
    content effectively.

4.  <span>**Nurture students as research-scholars.**</span>
    Project-oriented courses are ideal for teaching students about
    research methods, including how to ask good questions and use the
    scientific method. <span>**I encourage questions by acknowledging
    the value of any that are asked**</span>, and try to follow-up with
    more details by e-mail or class discussion board. Although students
    benefit from learning the basic skills of research, those skills are
    not teachable until students possess deep background
    knowledge @daniel_t._willingham_why_2009. Thus, I incorporate
    research methods primarily in upper-division and graduate
    coursework. When evaluating student work, I critique methods,
    analyses, and presentation of results more than artifacts (code).
    <span>**By providing students with the framework to conduct
    research, I give students the experience and skills needed to thrive
    in challenging jobs.**</span> For example, a student in my OS lab,
    Dan Fego, turned his team’s OS term project into a senior design
    capstone project. The team’s project took filesystem snapshots and
    supported roll-back of some file attributes. Dan re-designed and
    extended the project to include support for more file attributes and
    file contents. He later told me the experience—especially kernel
    hacking—was instrumental in helping land his first job.

#### Summary

The above principles serve to focus and guide my teaching. Student
successes like Mackenzie’s, Dan’s, and Irie’s motivate me to become a
better teacher, which I do by seeking advice, reading about what works
(and what does not), and evaluating my teaching efficacy through
self-examination, informal conversations with students, and anonymous
feedback.
