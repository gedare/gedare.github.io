  <div class="boxtop">Overview</div>

    This page describes some of my open-source software projects and
    contributed work. A lot of this software was written while conducting
    various <a href="research.html">research</a> projects.

  <div class="boxtop">More to come</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    I'm still working on organizing this material, and almost always writing
    new code. Come back in awhile.

  <div class="boxtop">RTEMS</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    I am an active contributor and committer to the
    <a href="www.rtems.org">RTEMS Project</a>, an
    open-source real-time operating system in use by
    industry, government, academia, and hobbyists.
  </div> <br />
  <div class="boxp">
    Some of the larger projects I've done include:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Porting RTEMS to the sparc64. I wrote a description on my
      <a href="http://gedare-csphd.blogspot.com/2010/06/sparc-v9-sparc64-rtems.html">blog</a>.
      The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rtemssparc64/">code</a>
      is available on Google Code, and it has been merged upstream.
      </li>
      <li>
      Refactoring the thread scheduler. I wrote a description on my
      <a href="http://gedare-csphd.blogspot.com/2010/12/rtems-adding-new-scheduler.html">blog</a>.
      The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rtems-sched/">code</a>
      is available on Google Code, and it has been merged upstream.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div><br />

  <div class="boxp">
    Some unmerged or archival projects may be found as branches on my
    <a href="https://github.com/gedare/rtems">github fork</a>.
    </div><br />
</div>

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">gem5</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    I hack on and make contributions (mostly bug fixes) to the
    <a href="http://www.m5sim.org/Main_Page">gem5</a> simulator.

    My mirror of gem5 on
    <a href="https://github.com/gedare/gem5">github</a> will hopefully
    start to collect small projects.

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">C++ STL Data Structure Profiling</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    I implemented some timing and operation counting within the gcc 4.7.1
    (libstdc++) STL profile mode. The code is available on
    <a href="https://github.com/gedare/stlprof">github</a>, and it has not been
    merged upstream yet. I updated some parts of it to 4.9.2, but the patch
    fell through the cracks. I described this effort on my
    <a href="http://gedare-csphd.blogspot.com/2013/01/profiling-c-applications-class.html">blog</a>.
  </div> <br />

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Fetch flagged email</div>
  <div class="boxp">
      I wrote a
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fetch-flagged-email/">
      Python script</a> to ease downloading and applying git patches from
      gmail.
    </ul>
  </div> <br />
</div>

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Secure Bulletin Board</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    Stefan Popoveniuc and I implemented a secure bulletin board service
    for electronic voting. I implemented the back-end consisting of
    cryptographic multisignatures and majority-rule consensus
    among mutually untrusting servers in C with the
    <a href="www.spread.org">Spread toolkit</a>.
    Stefan implemented the front-end.
    The code is not currently available, but I might drop it on github someday.

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Healthcare Informatics</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    As an applications analyst for <a href="http://www.bloomroad.com/">Bloom
      Road Consulting Group LLC</a> I wrote a handful of C++ data processing
    applications, along with a number of scripts and modules for Word, Excel,
    and Base. This software was all proprietary, although I do retain the right
    to produce derivative works in most cases.
  </div> <br />

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Particulate Matter Segregation</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    As an industry-funded undergraduate research project, Justin Ter Avest and I
    implemented a
    <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0032591086850057">
      Monte Carlo simulation of particulate matter segregation</a> in
    Unified Parallel C (UPC). I implemented the back-end physics engine and
    collision detection algorithms, and Justin implemented the graphics and
    networking subsystems.
    The code is not currently available; I have it archived, but I am
    not certain about my intellectual property rights to it. At any rate,
    I doubt anyone would find it terribly useful, but if you are curious
    drop me a line and I can find out if I can share any of it.
  </div> <br />

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Driving Simulator: Super X Racer</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    4 fellow students and I implemented &quot;Super X Racer&quot;, 
    a 3-D driving simulation written in C++ with OpenGL and GLUT
    as a semester-long project in a software development undergraduate class.
    My primary responsibility was to implement the physics engine, which
    included acceleration, braking, environment interaction (friction,
    collision detection), and turning radius enforcement. We all participated
    in the software requirements specification and design.
    The code is not currently available, although I think I have it somewhere
    on a CD.

<div class="box">
  <div class="boxtop">Diablo II Item Descriptor</div>
  <div class="boxp">
    My earliest released code was a relatively simple program that I wrote in
    High School that let users explore the range of item modifiers in Diablo II.
    I put the software up on some fan-site that collected such applications,
    and it is still
    <a href="http://www.gamefront.com/files/13476/Diablo_2_Item_Descriptor">
      hosted today</a>.
    It was downloaded over a thousand times, which made me feel pretty cool
    at the time. Of course, the users were probably hoping it actually
    was an item hack, which it was not. (Much h8 for cheaters.)
    I never released the source code, although I do still have it; I don't
    think it is particularly any good or useful.
