	abstract = {As the processor feature sizes shrink, mitigating faults in low level system services has become a critical aspect of dependable system design. In this paper we introduce SuperGlue, an interface description language (IDL) and compiler for recovery from transient faults in a component-based operating system. SuperGlue generates code for interface-driven recovery that uses commodity hardware isolation, micro-rebooting, and interface-directed fault recovery to provide predictable and efficient recovery from faults that impact low-level system services. SuperGlue decreases the amount of recovery code system designers need to implement by an order of magnitude, and replaces it with declarative specifications. We evaluate SuperGlue with a fault injection campaign in low-level system components (e.g., memory mapping manager and scheduler). Additionally, we evaluate the performance of SuperGlue in a web-server application. Results show that SuperGlue improves system reliability with only a small performance degradation of 11.84\%.},
