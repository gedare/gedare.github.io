	abstract = {The landscape of automotive in-vehicle networks is changing driven by the vast options for infotainment features and progress toward fully-autonomous vehicles. However, the security of automotive networks is lagging behind feature-driven technologies, and new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered. In this paper, we introduce a road map towards a security solution for in-vehicle networks that can detect anomalous and failed states of the network and adaptively respond in real-time to maintain a fail-operational system.},
