	abstract = {This chapter explores cyber-physical system security as it relates to computer hardware. Cyber-physical systems must ensure that physical compromises do not automatically lead to cyber compromises. Attacks on the processor supply chain represent a serious threat to cyber-physical systems – more so than servers and desktops – because critical control systems rely on hardware's trustworthiness, without which catastrophe would result: trains, planes, and automobiles crashing, satellites failing, unmanned robots running amok – think of any real-time or embedded system and you will find a piece of hardware whose correctness and security is assumed implicitly. We discuss supply chain security for the design and fabrication of processor hardware in Section 12.2. Physical compromise of fielded devices offers an attacker with unique opportunities for studying, copying, and corrupting components of a cyber-physical system. If the hardware does not protect itself and its software, then little can be done against a sufficiently motivated and resourceful attack. In Section 12.3, we examine how hardware helps make software secure and consider in particular the challenging aspects of computer security for devices that are not physically secured.

Keywords: Trojan circuit, design for hardware trust, memory protection, control flow integrity, secure coprocessing, encrypted execution, and data.},
