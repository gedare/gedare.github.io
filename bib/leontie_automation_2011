	abstract = {Hardware containers provide fine-grained memory access control to isolate memory regions and sandbox memory references between components of an application. A hardware reference monitor enforces a security manifest of memory access permissions for the currently executing component. In this paper we discuss how automation tools can help software developers to create the security manifest that configures hardware containers. The goal of this work is to foster discussion about our proposals for automation tools: to date we know of no solutions for extracting the metadata (permissions) required for fine-grained memory access control.},
