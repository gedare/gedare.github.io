	abstract = {Thanks to its distributed and asynchronous medium access control mechanism, CAN is the ideal choice for interconnecting devices in event-driven systems. When timing requirements of applications are not particularly demanding, as in the case of, e.g., reactive and proactive maintenance, constraints on event delivery can be relaxed, so that their notification may rely on best-effort approaches. In this paper, a number of techniques are taken into account for notifying events in such a kind of systems, and their performance has been evaluated. Besides conventional CAN, a recent proposal for extending this protocol, termed CAN XR, is considered. Moreover, the adoption of Bloom filters to cope with rare events in very large systems has also been evaluated.},
