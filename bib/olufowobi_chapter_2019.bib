	abstract = {This chapter examines the cybersecurity and privacy of the twin notions of smart transportation and intelligent transportation systems with a focus on the role of personal automobiles. Smart transportation encompasses the individual and joint capabilities of connected cars, or more generally, vehicles, and so comprises the internal workings of autonomous vehicles and the complex interdependencies introduced by vehicle-to-vehicle communications. An intelligent transportation system introduces smart technology to civil transportation infrastructure, and the connected car further creates the opportunity for vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. We identify threats and attacks enabled by smart transportation and intelligent transportation systems, and survey methods for providing security and privacy.},
