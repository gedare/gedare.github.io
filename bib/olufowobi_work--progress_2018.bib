	abstract = {Security of vehicular networks has often been an afterthought since they are designed traditionally to be a closed system. An attack could lead to catastrophic effect which may include loss of human life or severe injury to the driver and passengers of the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to extract the real-time model of the controller area network (CAN) and develop a specification-based intrusion detection system (IDS) using anomaly-based supervised learning with the real-time model as input. We evaluate IDS performance with real CAN logs collected from a sedan car.},
